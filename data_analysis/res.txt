It will help if you give some details of which database you are using as techniques vary.
One of the things that make a url user-friendly is 'discover-ability', meaning you can take a guess at url's simply from the address bar. http://i.love.pets.com/search/cats+dogs could easily lead to http://i.love.pets.com/search/pug+puppies etc
I agree, both CodeRush and RefactorPro are visually impressive (most of which can be turned off BTW), but for navigating and refactoring Resharper is much better in my opinion of using both products.
Just wanted to mention that this is an excellent solution if you consider the problem to be linear (i.e. treating `A1B2` as a single number). I still think the problem is multi-dimensional, but I guess we'll just have to wait for the author to clarify :)
Indeed, the only way to do this is get the server to generate your CSS file which can be done in many ways depending on which language you are using. HttpHandlers are common in C#.  You could use jQuery or the likes to add styling to every element with the class 'ourColur' and parametrise your JS
This advice goes against the spirit of CSS, which is separation of content and presentation. You way requires changing HTML for presentation sake, and stating in content which elements have same color.
It was bad when people used table for everything (because CSS did not exist yet). Now, it the other way round sometimes. Someone would describe a table functionality and ask how to do it without a table, as if tables are inherently bad. Sigh.
In the interests of tact, this is the kind of answer that should probably be made community wiki editable. Can someone with the right priveleges do that and add the Emacs bits?
The Digg link was the first one I came across when going down the main page. It's purely coincidental that it also so happens to exemplify how far Digg has fallen - a story about sex addiction has been posted three times.
concat infact doesn't do that.  I've edited my post with a decompilation of the concat method
infact it does. Look a the first lines of your concat code. The problem with concat is that it always generates a new String()
Yep. I have been thinking about that and will probably try it out in a later release. The only reservation I have is that the processing is far shorter than the I/O latency, so there may not be much benefit.
"Currently + is implemented using StringBuffer" False  It's StringBuilder.   StringBuffer is the threadsafe impl of StringBuilder.
I am assuming that this will work *only* if the user has an MP3 player installed, correct?
Bloats the HTML & complicates application of styles.  E.g.,  <H1.PageTitle>  This is the title of the page</H1> I want to have ALL the style for PageTitle in the CSS. With the method proposed, I'd need to wrap the above html in <span.a=theme-color> which doubles the CSS code a
I don't think that's the magic number he was refering to
Maybe you should remove the "file-format" and "networking" tags you added because he's clearly not talking about those kinds of magic numbers.
Can you be more specific on why eliminating maginc numbers ISN'T alway good?
Thanks! That's what I was looking for. For those wondering where to get the Profiler from the video:  http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=13356
It's still very useful to know that magic numbers may refer to more than simply a code issue.  -Adam
You're really going to have to be more specific...  Are you looking for websites that contain web snippets and tutorials? Code snippets themselves on a particular topic? This is a very, very general question.
You should always try to use the header() function at the last moment possible (such as, before the imagepng() funciton).  The way it is now, if the php script dies "Cannot Initialize new GD image stream" the browser will try to interpret it as a gif, so it won't be intelligible.
Have you even used any code snippets? There is no "best" code snippets.  There are snippets that are more "useful" than others, but no "best" snippets.  I wish i can edit the title...
As noted in other answers (including mine), the claims made in this answer are not correct. I would recommend deletion (if only to avoid enforcing this (probably common) misconception).
If you want to put something on the stack but don't know how big it is at compile time, alloca() can enlarge the stack frame to make room. There is no freea(), the entire stack frame is popped when the function returns.  Using alloca() for large allocations is fraught with peril.
Please see my post below where I show, in my opinion conclusively, that the switch statement does a constant time branch.
How would you handle the case where it wasn't a neat power of two number?
Can you call .vbs scripts from .bat files?
I agree with you 100%, however, do you have an alternative to modulus in the case where performance matters?
I meant division and modulus is 5-10 times faster on a micro with an integer division op code in the instruction set.
Oh, sorry, I misunderstood. (Clearly.) Have you profiled the other suggestion?
Sure. I guess I'm asking in case someone can give me some really compelling example on the side of good.
Yes, I see that too. I changed it to 7 because 6 evently divisible by two. I'm looking for an answer that could be used for any number known up front.
Wow, if I ever have to do it for a number other than 7, I'll have to come back and re-read this post.
How big of an application did you move?  Was it mostly your typical CRUD or did you have complex Javascript?
Any specific reason you are not using the built in SessionPageStatePersister? http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.sessionpagestatepersister.aspx
As stated in the article linked in the question, the asp.net worker thread does indeed come from the runtimes thread pool.
What is your question? What is not working as it should?
This *is* the right direction, but using recursion like that breaks the O(1) restriction: The call stack will just keep growing in proportion to the word count in the input.  Also, you use reverse(foo.begin(), foo.end()) before the while loop - this is a **BUG**, as there is no way of terminating!
Thank you very much for your reply, Brian. Please see Ivan Hamilton's reply ((48259)[http://beta.stackoverflow.com/questions/44905/#48259]). In short: you are talking about the `switch` _instruction_ (of the CIL) which is not the same as the `switch` statement of C#.
The results of your experiments surprise me a bit. Did you swap yours with Brian's? His results do show an increase with size while yours don't. I'm a missing something?  In any case, thanks for the clear reply.
This implementation is also nice if you wish to remove characters that look the same such as "l" and "1", "O" and "0". This is worthwhile when generating new passwords for users.
Doesn't that suggest that in fact the previous socket is still there and bound to the port?  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc319473.aspx  ReuseAddress   A value you use to allow binding to an address that is already in use.  *is* in use, not *has been*
That's not full text searching, it's searching the logs and filenames.
That's not full text searching, it's searching the logs and filenames.
Oops (concerning above comment): I failed to notice that Leon is using two different reverse() functions, and is thus not using recursion at all. My appologies! Leon, could you please edit your post and add a std:: qualifier to reverse(foo.begin(), fo.end())?
A side note, but people really use ObjectDataSource? I've never seen one use of it outside of MS examples...Its so ugly.
The ObjectDataSource was a copy&paste from the cited source. I have almost never seen it in the wild tough.
I'd almost hope people not know about this feature. Far preferable that they organise their code into smaller, more meaningful methods and simply use `return`, in most cases. There is a great furore at the moment around this language construct being added to PHP6.
VS 2008's XAML Editor doesn't recognize that as a chord.
VolkerK; I think you're right.  This is where you have to be careful and make sure that the previous instance really is gone; by default, Berkley sockets will wait for 5 minutes before releasing a port/socket combination; this is the only workaround I found to work.
Its possible that IPAddress.Any is whats permitting this to work (its using different IP Addresses each time).   In any case, this wouldn't solve the problem (sorry for being unclear): ClassA is a network-communications manager class and the Socket is a class-wide variable.
It's difficult to accurately calcuate timing with such a small operation. We didn't share code, or testing procedures. I can't see why his times should increase for adjacent cases. Mine were 10x faster, so environments & test code may vary greatly.
"""To add other OpenID providers, enter the URL for your provider in the Add Provider field and click Add. Your provider must support the SeatBelt extension """  Unfortunately, not many OpenID providers actually support seatbelt, making it a bit of a damp squib...
That's a nice idea, though to be pedantic the t.Rows.Any() line won't compile as dataSet.Tables.Rows is a DataRowCollection which doesn't implement IEnumerable<T> so .Any() is not available.
Your statement on variance doesn't make sense. In a subtype: Covariance = the related type being subtyped & Contravariance = related type getting supertyped. This question represents a covariant (subtype used in a subtype) return type, when C# only allows an invariant (same) return type.
Oh, and sorry to be even more horribly critical but the extension method will not work when the dataset is null, rather a NullReferenceException will be raised. In addition IsEmpty() is returning the opposite of what it should - it indicates whether it's *not* empty!!
In vim you can open > 1 buffer. :e filename. Then :bn and :bp go to the next and previous buffers. I have TAB mapped to :bn in normal mode, works wonderfully. Also :split, ctrl-w to change windows... Vim does all of that.
Irrelevant. The question asks why can't a subtype override a method with a method whose return be a subtype of the overridee's return.
@macbirdie, many thanks for this suggestion. Can you provide, or link to, any examples of this approach? I'd also be interested in hearing some general techniques on securing such a script.
Be aware that this elegant looking solution may lead to complexities due to C# lack of generic variance support.
The only problem with ScintillaNET is that you'll have more unmanaged dependencies to pull Scintilla in.
SnippetCompiler http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/SnippetCompiler/ uses ActiPro for its editor, too.
Or you could just have a list of operations, returning the first error from applying each operation in the list in sequence.
I've just tried this and I couldn't get it to work unfortunately. When I add the directives as suggested, I get an Internal Server Error.
Specifically, I am looking for a list of things to try, avoid, or watch out for.
Sure, but what about a solution using O(1) memory?
@chakrit Yes, if you allready have a user-token you can follow the examples on this page: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/w070t6ka.aspx
Luckily a good editor (in my case, I know VIM can do it) will reformat all your code nicely at the touch of a button.
Actually, windows are coupled to threads, not processes.  You can have multiple message loops per process and it will let you have several completely independent windows.
So, in your opinion, what *is* the point of `const int & a_foo`?  Hint: there's none.
I believe the better practice is to use "select" instead of threading on a server.  http://ilab.cs.byu.edu/python/select/echoserver.html
I already have a client-side config solution in place. This no-touch requirement has newly dropped in my lap. Basically, we need to deploy to a massive amount of dummies end users with minimum administrative intervention. Thx anyway.
HTML is in fact not a subset of XML, but rather a descendant of SGML which has significantly more lenient syntax than XML. However your suggestion is still a good one, if he is working with XHTML (which _is_ XML) then an XML diff tool is key. BeyondCompare has a plugin for XML compares also.

It can also be helpful to name the foreign key constraint.  This helps with troubleshooting fk violations.  For example:  "foreign key fk_questionbank_exams ( question_exam_id ) references exams (exam_id)"

Nothing appears to be broken, but version numbers from CA and the DB aren't what they are supposed to be.
The MOSS upgrade did no dependency check.
To clarify, the sigar api gets you system info. If you want jvm info use JMX.
To add to this: You can also use partial classes in seperate files to manage your code a bit better. Put the inner class in a seperate file (SortedMap.TreeNode.cs in this case). This should keep your code clean, while also keeping your code seperated :)
In my question, I was more looking for what you like and dislike about a mock framework.  I can find the documentation and read all about it - I want to know what the people who have used it think of it.
This question might be better directed to the authors of the research paper. It's a bit esoteric for Stack Overflow. (I've always had great success contacting researchers for comment. They're usually ecstatic *anybody* is reading their work.)
This answer though correct isn't an answer to the original question.  Can someone with Editing rights reword it?
That did the trick. Google reveals the compiler directive to be {$J+}.  It's also in the project options, probably should have looked there :P
Yeah I've been struck by that before. (edited to add details after my initial post)
I think this attitude (that theoretical questions have no bearing on a pragmatic forum) is harmful and obsolete.   Pragmatic approaches should be open to new technologies, because those technologies can likely improve daily activities in the near future.  eg: functional features in c#/python.
That said, Chirs's comment is probably right-on, practically speaking.  I wish it weren't though.
Oh my god.  Is that the standard?  That's terrible!
That online Python interpreter is basically worthless for learning Python.  You can't define your own functions or classes, so it's not going to be much use to anyone.
Yes, I know which post you're talking about Justin. Reading it reminded me how most of the things I've learned have come from trying and learning from my own mistakes. I really can't emphasize enought the importance of learning by doing!
rcreswick: I don't think the question has no bearing. I just don't think the Stack Overflow community is likely to produce a satisfactory answer.
There are a few other ways to do it as shown above. I really thought the same.
Basically it's an ajax component, so it displays some data and then needs to special JS logic to call an action etc.  Which is why I would like it to be self contained; so you can just drop one of them in and be done with it.
I'd like to help, but I've read your Q several times and I'm just not sure what you are asking for. Can you try rephrasing your Q and be very precise.. e.g. you've defined a custom list -- did you define a list template or create a custom list? Why is it important that you installed it as a feature?
On the right track. See edit comments in question for further details.
Can you please tell me where you see the discrepancy between the Q and A? I'll be happy to reword the answer.
Good answer, but you might want to include the for ((i=0; i<MAX; i++)); do doSomething($i); done variant as well. I think this generally preferred to the for i in $(seq 0 MAX) variant as the latter will first generate all numbers from 0 to MAX before actually executing the loop.
thanks for the answer, but this didn't work :( see http://www.codeplex.com/blogengine/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=33705
I like ceejayoz's answer bot OwenP's seems to reflect my own situation precisely. His answer also pointed me to  1. how **%HOMEDRIVE%\%HOMEPATH%** created my problem 1. And how the AutoRun registry entry would solve my problem.  Thanks to all who answered.
With 2 million files, that is likely to return only a "command line too long" error.
Accepted because this deals with concurrency which is an issue with the testing since the main app thread terminates before BackgroundWorkers have completed their operation (and I got tired of adding Thread.Sleep!)
sqlprofiler is exactly what I needed, thank you!. It took me a while to figure out what events I needed to log (RPCCompleted) for my purposes, but seeing the amount of events you can log, I think it will also suit your needs as well.
This will return an IEnumerable<int>, not a List<int>, so like aku noted, you'll want to call .ToList() on the Enumerable.Range(x,y) call.
Sounds like a good excuse to deploy Firefox via Group Policy =)
Ah, I didn't know that. That is very cool thank you for clearing that up :-)
By prevent, do you mean "prevent it from appearing as a link" or to totally prevent it from working as a link?
Will this also get nested controls? Page.FindControl (if I remember correctly) does not search recursivly...
I don't think that putting javascript in href is "The Proper Way", although it works.
Both, but it already doesn't look like a link, thats been done with CSS. I just need to make it not clickable too.
The code that generates this link is already quite complex and I am reluctant to add yet more complexity by adding conditional code around it to output it as a label instead of a hyperlink if I can avoid it.
I do not want it to appear as a link or work as a link. I know that really it should be a label under this particular circumstance. However the code involved is already quite complex and I am reluctant to add more complexity with an 'if' statement if say CSS can do the job.
WebServiceX does not cover all service providers in India
I should have been more specific stating that I require it in India.
Ouch. I edited this one too many times I think... now it's a community post! Oh well. :-)
Well, I would rather prefer to have an option to do it several ways. For example, I saw people using System.exit(1); in Servlet and EJB code, but that does not mean that we should remove System.exit(); from the JDK, right?
Thanks for this, it didn't quite work exactly but did point me in the right direction. Instead of undefining wxUSE_CONFIG_NATIVE, redefining wxUSE_CONFIG_NATIVE from its default of 1 to 0 instead does work.
@BlaM: Unfortunately the ID is a GUID and not an Int. (Which you could not know at the time). Sorry.
Mark, I tried this but SQL Sercver complains abt the where clause. I didn't know you could do "WHERE   (ThingID, PriceDateTime) IN ..."?
Correct - using JQuery to encrypt the email address will be useless, seeing as any Bot scrapping your HTML will not be running the JQuery.
For a full list of predefined number formatting options: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dwhawy9k.aspx  An alternative would be to use ToString("D2")
actually, it's svnADMIN hotcopy. Which means that this, too, will require repository filesystem access!
That's a good question. I assume we want to find the specific needle, i.e. one you have lost in a haystack. If you just wanted to find any needle, the magnet approach suggested earlier would also work... ;)
It will not find controls inside a listview-type control, no.
your solution does not redirect to blah.domain.com but just rewrites to something.blah.domain.com/something, which is not how I read the original question.
I guess that is OK if they are both served by the same VirtualHost.  In particular, doing it this way means the client doesn't see the redirection - they still see something.blah.example.com.
I have mainly worked with SQL Server 2000, so this is a new concept to me. Technically, will that create a temporary table with all rows and then run the "function" over the temporary table? How does that compare in speed to my "JOINed" solution?
That was fast! I thought my own solution was unique, but you came up with something similar to start with in just a few moments.
Actually, you don't even need a server. Simply installing TortoiseSVN and running against a local repository will suffice.
Nice :) Seems Prototype has learned some new tricks since I last used it!
Classic article, I remember when it was first published. Those were heady, exciting times.
Jeff's post on how to set up subversion on windows: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001093.html
Yes, you are right. However because the question stated windowed applications I assumed this is the case.
as long as you're using MD5 as a signature, you might as well use a proper asymmetric key signature.
Glad someone linked to msysgit, I've had much better results with it than the 'offical' Cygwin version.
You are getting it wrong. I'm asking about hackers bypassing the ASP page.
FlexeLint is a commercial product which has no development history in common with Johnson's original Unix Lint, AFAIK. A non-commercial alternative is Splint.
yes, I'm using an ASP page to do the upload, but...It is safe to give IUSR write permission to the folder? If a hacker try to post to same folder, IIS will be involved too.
Label/Textbox pairs should use the <label> tag.  With a little work  _{display:block;float:left;}_ you can style all the labels in a field set to have the desired width.
You also cannot guarantee that the MIME type is correct since this is passed by the browser (as I recall). One should open the image via something like ImageMagik and check that the dimensions can be read properly.
it's probably the most convenient method. Another solution would be to connect back to the server itself and re-upload the uploaded file via FTP for example, but the security benefit for the trouble is not really worth it.
This is awesome, thanks!  I converted your code to C#, and am able to call it from a WPF application and print out the macro code in a listbox.  I will post the C# version of the code in my edited answer.
Is IFRAME really necessary? Can someone confirm this? I am confused.

http://code.google.com/tos.html doesn't seem to mention open source, but there may be something that does when you create a project. Or I might have missed it in my quick reading.
and as long as there is cheap hardware requiring cheap thirdparty drivers, don't expect 64bit kernels happening any time soon :-)
64-bit Windows requires 64-bit drivers, and the kernel runs in 64-bit mode. You cannot run 32-bit drivers on 64-bit Windows. The example above is OS X, which doesn't have a separate 32- vs. 64-bit version (just the ability to run 64-bit apps on x64 w/ a 32-bit kernel).
No, i will not pardon the pun as it was more clever and subtle than pun.  80)
Maybe I misunderstood something, but why can't you just use scp directly? With stored keys you don't have to enter any passwords either.
That's invalid CSS: '0' does not have a unit. Should just be "border-width: 0;".
This seems to be dependant on loading a regular Dll not a .net assembly.
I'm pretty sure there's an easier way that doesn't require dasBlog source.  I'll keep it in mind, though, in case I'm wrong.
attention: Your <img> tag is not correct. Either you have to use " to quote the border attribute value (because XML requires that), or you have to remove the / before the ending > (because SGML/HTML doesn't allow that)
I am not having any real assembly loading problems. I am trying to understand the search/load order from an academic perspective.
And you're right about '%path%'... I had mistaken this from some work with p/invoke calls (I used '%path%' to simplify the 'DllImportAttribute' use).
The decision not to upgrade is because of lack of (programmer) resources.  It works, and only needs minimal support so we don't want to touch it at this point.
Wow really, just out of curiosity what products have you seen this with. Often i have had licenses transferred from my name to a company name and have yet to pay any transfer fee.
The cases are locations so location 1-200+   ** I did not write the code :D **
I can understand the argument that the user of Animal should only know about Leg objects, but I'm less convinced that this should be hidden from the users of the Dog class.
Wow! Thanks. Didn't realize that jQuery abstracted that so well. You rock! I would think it would still have the difference between (this) and (event.target) -- being object you bound the event to vs. the object that received the event.
See my answer for more details, but for my simple case this was the easiest approach.
Marshall - one of the requirements was a distributed source control. Does Tortoise support one of the SVN-based DVCSeS?
I had no trouble with cross-platform ASMX services--XML does quite nicely there. I understand that WCF = remoting + ASMX + MSMQ + WSE. My beef is that MS should use a little "progressive enhancement" to make WCF more easily approachable and my question is how! Thanks, rp
Mainstream support for the framework (1.1) ends at the same time

This is a great answer (I've up-voted it) but can you explain the "grep -P '\t.*so'" command? According to man, this interprets the pattern as a perl regexp, but my version of grep doesn't support it (man indicates this is a general issue). What bit of the regexp is perl-specific?
It is the first link return by google search for *java closure example*
WCF: Just like I'm encouraged to use .NET 3.5 :) Sadly, not an option Remoting seems like the way to go.
Well, the OP asks for distributed VC, then suggests that they didn't choose Subversion because it was hard - not because it didn't fit their requirement.  So it would seem that an 'easy' subversion would eliminate the only concern the OP has with it. -Adam
By "abstract class" you mean aonymous inner class?
Agreed, just for convenient map/filter implementations it would be worth it. Not to mention most uses of anonymous inner classes. Readability and code size counts.
display: inline-block worked fine in Firefox but in IE makes width to be 100%

Hi, Chris.  Audio Queue Services do indeed present a nice, clean API.  I ended up going with portaudio with this project for Tiger compatibility, but have been gazing enviously at AQRecord.
No, but I most definitely will one day. :)   Maybe a project structure template or something.
build in tfs, not so good, even if you use it, I recommend running cruise control in tandem so that you can actually be independent of your source control. (i.e. tfs 2005, won't build vs 2008 solutions)
I agree about the bookmarking and back button, but it's not my choice :(
I've been told by others that its harmful, and haven't tried it personally. This seems to be the reason that many more advanced devs are VMing their development machines so that its a clean single purpose install with almost no updates. While maintaining their other apps on a dirtier/slower install
Our application presents data from a lot of different back in systems. It brings that data into one place. Our CRUD type stuff was mostly in the admin part of the site. We're using the yui javascript framework for layout and ajax stuff. It's a pretty large application though about 38,000 LOC.
I'm personally getting used to running my dev machine vm on one monitor and the host OS on the other monitor and being able to have it feel as if its really 1 install on 2 monitors, working nicely for me.
I'm not convinced that I like the idea of buttons disappearing. Unless another (disabled button) took their place. It might get confusing to the end user... no?
This looks like a much more powerful way to do deployment, but how can I configure it to ignore my _ReSharper files?
I agree with Rob, I don't like buttons dissapearing
If you have a Windows server around with Server 2003 or higher, SharePoint (Services? I can never remember) is a good no cost solution. It provides simple versioning and basic work-flow.
This is almost what I want. However, I'd like to be able to do this even if I am not using integers. I'd like to use reference objects, but they do not behave properly as keys in dictionaries.
If its Server Based, what is the platform? I have no idea how well things like COM interop work with Mono, so that's another factor to consider.

Using a different port worked for me.  (3000 = good, 4242 = no good)  Which is good, because unbinding really wasn't an option.  The event log messages were very cryptic and not helpful at all.  Hex codes and such.
There is also a GCC note for this at http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/x87note  Due to this wonderful behaviour, comparing floating point computations is also inherently broken, unless using pre-computed values.
Agree! No self-respecting C compiler will ever do this. SILENTLY OVERFLOW BABY! And we wouldn't have it any other way. This is what's great about C, after all.
Well, I totally agree...I'm a big fan of both SubSonic and NHibernate, but in this case I think the Client is going to pretty much always push back.

This is basically how the undo engine in Cocoa, NSUndoManager, works.
You might want to specify a programming language.  Behavior will vary depending on the language.
To decide the best answer I think you need to clarify if the try/catch blocks are indeed empty or not. As stated in one of the answers, the semantics is the same if the try/catch blocks are empty, otherwise different answers address the semantic differences.
I've always loved the daily wtf article that you linked - especially one of the comments that suggests we need a magicFairyFinally that's guaranteed to execute, even with no power!
I'm also curious about the answer to this; is there any reason ssh tunneling is insufficient?
Well, what has really changed about whois in the last 5 years.  I would venture to guess "not much".  I still think you are re-inventing the wheel.    My ideal answer is: use what is working for you now unless you perceive a real problem with it.
We considered this but to maintain strong typing of the functions it has to happen at a much lower level.
I agree with previous comments, you need to clarify on actual language and seriously review the answers given. The upmodded answers are either incorrect or incomplete.
I will add automatic splitting of files at a later date. A database for this situation is a bit heavy handed and I'd like logs to be able to stand alone also.

You're right.  It is a good reply but I guess it does not directly answer the stated question.  Maybe that means I should have asked a better question :)
we had to do the exact same thing. Wrap the output stream and prevent it from committing the response until we were ready.
That doesn't solve his problem because, if he hasn't added his new files, the server is oblivious to the existence of those files.
Can big sites take that risk right now? How many users will they loose (or rather, not gain) if they stop accepting traditional logins?
Wonderful use of LINQ with reflection - I hadn't thought to apply it to those tedious xxxInfo objects before. Thanks!
That actually sounds like a good idea. I'm already getting nightmares thinking how to get that mechanism work with AJAX, but i'll fight through that because i'm not happy with my current Response.Write(hardcoded html) approach, as a separate error.aspx has other advantanges.
Good to know, so one fix would be to blow up the response to at least 513 bytes which should be doable.
please define a language, as that is impled in your answer but not stated.
Thanks! My solution: I created an >512 Byte Error.aspx, but by Global.asax will set the StatusCode to 400 and then do a Server.Transfer instead of Response.Redirect. Works well with AJAX and Internet Explorer.
If you are already using TortoiseSVN, you can use TortoiseProc (commando line tool) instead of svn.  http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-automation.html
In math formulas like  e^pi + 1 = 0
Perfect.  Thanks.  I started down that road, but tried using override instead of virtual methods for GetScript*, which didn't work.  So, I thought it wasn't possible to implement both together.
Note that -maxdepth and -mindepth are not portable.  GNU find has those options and could be installed if needed, however.
I've been bit by that in the past. But I should point out that on a modern Solaris box, -print is on by default. In fact, I can't seem to find a find that doesn't work that way any more.
Everyone here is right. I guess I was going for brevity. I've noticed that the early answers get all the upvotes. ;-)
I can't seem to get this to work. The color index is coming out to 55 when there are 6 cells with the color.
Ahhh... execfile is tricky.  See my other post about using the inspect module.
Can you give an example of what you mean by "recognise a path from the command line arguments"? Might be worth starting a new question as everyone has answered the first part.
SharePoint Services looks like a free download it appears - not sure of the limitations though. http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb400746.aspx
it should be ^example\.com$ instead. In any case I'm under the impression that chris wants a generic solution, not one for a single domain.
I just gave you an upvote that threw you above 2000 points - hopefully it will stick. :P
The implication of this, is that union is much less performant as it must scan the result for duplicates
If I then issue a svn update on the trunk directory will it pull down all the other folders, or just update the ones that have already been retrieved?
You posted this while I was typing an almost identical suggestion :)
Oh I do---if I have to. But Cygwin X Windows is so much nicer.  And Cygwin still works just as it always has. The problem is with Vista.
Note that this solution doesn't preserve sign. Also, delta_ms = abs(t1_ms - t2_ms) is a little easier to understand and saves at least a subtraction.
I don't have forfiles on my XP (sp3) machine - where'd that come from?
The second case you mentioned is what I'm talking about: "an application that synchs with 10g database when online, but when offline uses a local store." I edited the question with this clarification.
DbDataReader is an abstract class
This is what I've tried, but it seems that the condition is always true at least once, but then if try to extract a value from the reader it throws an error.
Sorry - edited my question to clarify what I am after. Cheers
I would agree you really aren't losing anything by not using MSSQL.  .NET is larger than just MSSQL.  You still have all the AJAX features and controls with ASP.NET.
Excellent point, Lars. I read that as "Windows". Oops. Still, it may be useful information for someone, sometime...
I ran through the li:last-child selector earlier; however I cannot use it as it does not work in IE.  In this case I do not have control over the HTML, so I cannot tag the first and last childs accordingly.
In that case I'm afraid you're not going to get this to do what you want.  You could do it with javascript if you have control over that & you want to go down that road, but it's a dark, scary road with dragons ;)
I'm still looking for an answer to this.  Any ideas?
Doc link? I can't find any specifics on this.
I know there isn't a stringBuilder, msAjax has one, and I was just pondering whether or not its useful
I don't have a specific alternative.  If I couldn't use a bitmask or right shift like @Paul-Tomblin suggested, I'd keep a counter, just like you suggested in your question.  Of course, I'm used to working with more overhead (we're running CORBA on our processors).
I agree that vim can do it, but once you have multiple buffers open, you have to cycle through them or use the mouse to select from a menu.  In Emacs, the buffer name comes from the filename, and you can use that to select the buffer, which is much more usable.  I am intrigued by mapping tab to :bn.
This was the most elegant solution since it uses built-in functionality that is abstracted very well by the Visual Basic library.  I didn't know how to create a VB ApplicationBase program, so more research was needed...I'll add more info for completeness. Thanks for all the great feedback!!
You're passing parameters via GET not POST as author requested
You should also know that RawUrl, unlike Request.Url, represents the original, unmapped request url if url mapping is being used.
What indicates this?  I'm using the TEA algorithm to encrypt the data, but it encrypts 8 bytes at a time.  Rather than including meta data inside the encrypted file to tell me how big the original data was, I'm padding the original out to an 8 byte boundary, and leaving the padding in place.
I know there is a %PATH% variable, but it is not as integrated as in UNIX systems. For instance, the application I'm looking for is OpenOffice. Such software would not be in %PATH%, typically.
This is, indeed, very interesting.
My blog (http://dotnet.kapenilattex.com) runs on a barebones Wordpress installation and has served my purposes well.
I'd like you to clarify the context of your question, e.g., what is your personal experience with regards to inefficient knowledge transfer? Maybe that can help us answer you. :)
There is never a reason to use CType(var, String) instead of CStr(var), they do exactly the same thing.
DirectCast is faster than CStr, but you can only use it when casting a string object into a string variable. It will fail if you try to convert any other object into a string.
if (type.IsGenericType AndAlso type.GetGenericTypeDefinition Is  GetType(Nullable))
This seems like an awful lot of work and overhead for a Web Service?!
You can host the blog files on your own web server, too, so you will only use blogger's functionality.
Your VB code won't work. VB only supports anonymous functions in this version, you have to wait until VB10 to have anonymous subroutines.
VB has anonymous delegates, that's just another term for anonymous functions.  What VB doesn't have is anonymous subroutines. All anonymous delegates in VB must return a value.
Yes and no. VB has anonymous functions, but not anonymous subroutines. Since event handlers are always subroutines, VB developers miss out here.
Just to add: Normally, a Response.Redirect would also be a viable solution. However, if you use ASP.net AJAX, you will also be redirected. Server.Transfer does allow you to stay on the current Page for AJAX-Requests and handle the error in JavaScript. See my HttpRequestValidationException question.
VB has anonymous functions, just so long as they return a value.  There is no such thing as an anonymous method. A method, by definition, is a named function that implicitly takes an object reference.
You totally forget VB's XML support.
CLS compliance doesn't care about private field names.
we will eventually be able to merge accounts if I can get to that any time soon. This will take a manual request to a moderator, but it's doable.
I've met Ted, for the record, and I don't agree. The point, I think, is that your OpenID experience will be heavily colored by the quality of the provider you choose.
myopenid.com is my recommendation -- they have a great UI and deliver an excellent experience.
Excellent Ivan. This is pretty much exactly what I want.
Windows has had JVM pre-installed since Windows 95: http://www.microsoft.com/mscorp/java/faq.mspx
Thanks for your answer, but it's not exactly what I need. I tried to improve my question above and added some more specific requirements.
The first paragaraph is the most-heard issue here too. It's like people won't talk about the knowledge because they feel frightened by "loosing" it. This is definitly the most mind-changing thing you are faced when you try to establish knowledge transfer...
Not applicable in a project based environment with flexible work hours and small teams. You won't ever meet someone who's not in your team when you're having lunch here... the kitchen isn't for rumours here. :-(
Rob, web service is not always a WSDL\SOAP goodness. Sometimes you need to get and parse data from server yourself. One strange thing about this question is a POST method. Usually such simple services use GET.
unusable (which was the question) is not the same as reducing it's usability.  Bit of a nickpick, I'll grant.  But, an important distinction because it may be a viable solution.
My way to change the current way is to talk a lot about the wiki and the way you can just write your notes down and search for them later... I think it's true that you have to constantly remind people about the benefits.
Thanks for the link - that was just what I needed. Thanks to everyone else for their answers as well.
Ah, the link, always with the link
Xinc may be another option for continuous integration. It is more PHP specific. http://sourceforge.net/projects/xinc
As a general principle I agree, but in the real world there are many instances where Excel is a key part of a business and many business processes have been built around it. When these need to be scaled, the only option often is to run Excel as a server side component.
Don't worry, some of us UP-voted you :) I totally agree - running Excel as some kind of data-processor (server OR client side) seems insane. Excel is a (bloated) front-end user application, not something that should be used for backend processing.
This is actually one good example of 'code-reuse' in Joel's article "Why are the Microsoft Office file formats so complicated?"
I've heard about Google protocol buffers but never bother to take a look at them. Did you have any experience with that Google stuff?
I already mentioned JASON, do you know some alternative to it ?
No practical experience. We use JSON at work but I had read the docs of Google's protocol buffers a bit and thought they might be worth it whenever JSON won't be suited enough.
But if a NullPointerException is raised with ObjectA a = getTheUser(session.getState().getAccount().getAccountNumber()); which object in the train is null?  Session, State, Account, AccountNumber or the User being returned from the original funciton?
Wanna fix up the title a bit? :)
What do you mean by "Up and running" ?
Please read my question carefully. YAML doesn't support attribute at all.
By "Up and running", I mean to configure the critic as per my needs (I know there is Perl::Critic::Config, but being perl coder, I am trying to be very lazy :) ) and run it on my code base. I will update the question.
Can you describe more about your build environment. For example, do you have UNIX command line type tools available and the build is done using Make or something similar. I could describe a script based solution to do this in that case...
I believe the Dojo currecy formatting is based on XML data from the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (http://unicode.org/cldr). While Dojo will do the hard work for you, if you don't want to use it you can get the raw data from there.
We're using instant messaging here a lot and it would be a no-brainer to setup a bot to receive status updates from team members.
I don't mean to rain on your parade, I intended this link as a supplementary resource. I'm still interested in ways to get the backtrace back to the developers (eg. kerneloops.org). So far it seems like gathering the environment and associated data is up to the individual developer.
I was getting a error related to the TopLevel property, something I couldn't set on a control, but could on a form.
As a person who wrote tons of those brackets, I can say there is a HUGE difference. You you don't know how YAML is different from XML, please read wikipedia articles linked in the question text.
"new" allocates memory from the heap, never from the stack. (Unless, of course, you have overridden the new operator.)
The accepted answer mentions the quagmire with developing your own. Ive seen the same with wordpress. Security updates again and again :(
Of course I won't broadcast confidential information over twitter. That's why I thought about the use of an internal twitter-like service.
C actually has two ways of reading files, one with the FILE object and one with the file descriptor.
What were your personal thoughts with prefuse? At my last job, a project started to use it, but ended up with a 90%+ rewritten (and optimized, with additions of new features) version of prefuse.
Just to clarify - it depends on how open the OTS system is. If it's easy to modify the system and share the data around, then it's a consideration, otherwise it's not a consideration?
Agreed, and I knew somebody would make this comment.  I really only needed this while trying to figure out a structure a module was creating so I could modify the module.  I wanted to delete a particular key from any hashes in the structure because they contained a raw JPEG.
Is this a question about how to use the samurize package?  Perhaps you could rephrase as a programming question?
Later I discovered that I could use Data::Dumper::sortkeys to filter this data so Data::Dumper didn't produce megabytes of binary output.
Yes, IFRAME is needed. You can't submit file uploads via AJAX (i.e. via the Javascript XMLHTTPRequest object) and just a normal form submit would prevent you from executing additional Javascript to poll the server for upload progress.
You might have better performance with constructing a Dictionary with the first query, as the Contains() call in the second query can then be done in O(1) as opposed to O(n).
I just tried this in VB.Net, and it works  System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("taskkill.exe", "-im excel.exe /f")
I am really interested in this question. Was hoping you would get some nice answers. But maybe everyone like me only upvoting your question and waiting :) Stay tuned.. Cheers - Prakash
I guess I should have been more specific.  I already have code similar to what you have above... I just needed a method for opening a second spreadsheet.  Over time, there will likely only be one edit a month or less to the first spreadsheet, so there will never be many changes to the second one.
tables are being created dynamically by the user. when user gets a new class of data (i.e. gets a collection of railroads from some source) and wants to input it in the application, new table is being created, and i need a way to access new data without doing a separate mapping to the new table.
that is what I am doing now. I find this a more practical solution and I see there are other people doing the same. Well, great!
It's not *quite* as big a step as it may seem in this case because I already have source code for a driver that works with my touchpad. I just need to modify it to tell the pad to disable "tap-to-click" which seems to be detected in the pad itself.
No, the mail.From address will determine the MAIL FROM in the envelope and in the DATA section.  I want to make those two different addresses.
Your method will work, but it will create unnecessary temp files.  Also, when using del in BATCH scripts, I always add the /Y switch - otherwise the del command can be very annoying... :)
This is on the development webserver for this project I don't want to compile it locally.
Could you clarify what you mean about log4net being "potentially dangerous"?
Given a list of (address, symbol type, symbol name) tuples from a map file, it's not immediately obvious what types of graphs could be constructed.  Could you revise the question to explain what you'd like to visualize?
Can you tell me what the %%i does in line 2 and what the %~1 does in line 7?   Thanks!
I dot't at this time but dang if that ain't nice!!
Actually I learned this trick from Sells book too. But Scott's article just seats among my bookmarks :)
I think it's implied in the question that he only wants to use things which would be available from a command line.  Do you know of a command line RE tool that would be available on Windows?
%%i is the loop variable (it will get the value of the first word in each line that the command inside parentheses writes to standard output).  %1 is a simple way to access the command line argument passed to the script or the label (like in my case). %~1, however, removes the quotes (if any).
Bad thing about teamcity is it wants you to use its source control
Oooh, nice, I didn't know that! I'll definitely look into this.
MAN!  Do you know of any good books on learning to write stuff like this?!
you could probably answer this question too! http://beta.stackoverflow.com/questions/51054/batch-file-to-delete-files-older-than-n-days
Actually, there's no real need for books. You can simply type HELP in command line, to get the list of all default commands. And then you can read the help of each individual command for more information - you just simple add the /? switch to the command. Or at least, that's how I do it.
You can use Subversion, Perforce, CVS, VSS, TFS with TeamCity
The reason the the querystring is read-only is that the querystring is provided by the browser. You can not do this without either iterating through the collection or just creating it again if you know all the key/value pairs that you need.
In theory you can just grab the compiled .dll and add a reference to that in your own project, but you _will_ need to use some of the dasBlog objects.  With that in mind, having source available to reference just makes things easier.
this looks like what i'm looking for. I'll try it out and report back :)
A man, a plan, a canal, Panama
"without iterating through the collection" ?
I +1'd this, I don't know who downmodded, I thought it was a reasonable hack?! :S
I havent downmoded anyone in this thread yet. But a downmod is labeled "this was not helpful", and so far very few of the answers has been helpfull so I can understand why some people might downmod them
Yeah, my answer is really a "you can't, you will have to rebuild it" since there's no way to do what he is asking without it. You could avoid the iteration and copy to a new array and remove the item, but you'll still have to iterate through it to create the URL to redirect to.
Thanks for the correction, I guess someone's gaming or having a bad day we're still in Beta afterall :) So sharing the love, +1 back.
I'd say estimating the basic overhead with an empty table is good. Since you're doing a full table scan, index use is probably irrelevant, which leaves the bulk (160 to 180 ms) of your 200 ms to loading data from disk and aggregation. Have you compared the two SELECTs as I suggested?
@Espo, I was really referring to Holly's post, seemed like a reasonable hack.. Looked like someone had just come in and -1'ed everyone..
Your directory name is easily handled by reverse find though :).
Microsoft no longer adds their Java-like product to Windows. However, any half-decent PC manufacturer will install the JRE on Windows. It's unusual for a Windows installation not to have Sun Java.
I would say nay on that, I butted my head against that wall for a month and there's got to be something better.  Far too clunky and an un-intuitive UI.
Striktly I would not allow IgnoreCase for a palindrome.
I can't re-tag at my 100 point rep-level, but we should add I18N and Windows (maybe Win32?) to this question.
Using O(n) memory where a in-place algorithm works would probably not impress a professor
Why not?  See http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/palindrome
Why not?  If case matters then "A man a plan a canal Panama" isn't a palindrome.
Ok. Please see my added comment about storing the data on a web server
Go hang a salami. I'm a lasagna hog.
Solutions like these are great because they are easy to follow. The solutions with loops, stacks, etc. are nice but harder to inspect than this one.  All this needs is a line or two to trim it down to a fixed alphabet (just [a-zA-Z] characters?).
Yes, it wasn't there when I replied... It's a good alternative but it's not possible (because of restrictions with the client) to publish information that way.
Then i do not have any more suggestions. Sorry :)
The only difference is that my code treats empty string as a palindrome. That is by design.
The setTimeout does not need the first parameter in quotes - you can call it thus: setTimeout(hideSpinner, spinnerShowTime); That saves the step of having the JS interpreter eval'ing the string, which is just overhead.
I think System.IO.Path works great. Do you have specific tasks that you need that it can't handle?
You'd have to remove the spaces from the string first, otherwise palindrome's like "a man a plan a canal panama" wouldn't check properly.
As I said in other comment, MSVS is just a huge wrapper over MSBuild files. You can use these files directly without touching IDE. I encourage you to learn more on MSBuild
Oh and for prototyping, use the in-memory SQLite database engine! (ADO.NET provider here <http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com/>)
By time consuming, do you mean that the server takes long to respond, or that it takes much effort to write the query?
In terms of the foolproof way of determining if a dll is from the .net framework or not, the best I can do is the using the Codebase property of the Assembly object, which for mscorlib is "C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework, however it isn't for all .net framework assemblies.
I try. I often fail, but not this time, it would seem. Thanks.
This is a very difficult tool to install. I tried for about half an hour with no success. Any other suggestions?
That's the pitfall of using the Load event on the image - if you get someone with a fast connection, then the spinner just flicks on and off again.  You have to consider the spinner actually has two purposes: no only a "please wait", but also "something is/has happened"
It would quicker in this case, but in the situation where you wanted to pass in arguments to a function, I find enclosing the thing in dbleQts to cause less problems (at the expense of legibility I suppose)
I was going to suggest that you could edit your answer to add in the whitespace and punctuation handling from my answer below but then it wouldn't be so pretty.  :-)
Do you care about punctuation? Case? What about locale-sensitive case folding?
I wonder if you can query some Microsoft service for the public key tokens... like the way they provide a remote symbol server. That way you don't have to track it manually.
it only parses if the given text matches the pattern and returns the Date object representation of that string. It doesn't parse if the date information is somewhere within the other texts.  like "sometext 12/03/2004 sometext.
"No Checked Exceptions" is definitely not an improvement. I want to know what things can go wrong, rather than have to guess a few cases and hope that's all.
The issue here is that a lot of stuff is in the GAC according to AssemblyName and Assembly
If it fails to defrag any of the files PageDefrag will keep trying with each boot and can take a while, hence its option to run once.  This doesn't mean it's not a great tool and I heartily recommend it.  +1 from me.
So the database appender is what was giving Jeff the locking issues that he discussed in the podcast.  Unfortunately we are using the database appender because we wanted a centralized log repository.
Maybe I should clarify my question, I want to know what a dynamically typed Object is, so using TypeName will (in my case) only return "Object".
Very cool.  I didn't know you could do things like $$('#mytable tr').  That makes my life a lot easier.
I read this article during a code revisit. I followed some of the advice but I am very restricted in what I can do to the DB. I only got our sql server updated to 2005 about 6 months ago.
@swilliams code is nicer than my example, but I think you should use addClassName() rather than explicitly setting style in the JS.
That might be undecidable.  What if the text contains two dates, e.g. "Between A and B, blah" where A and B are dates...
@Mark Biek, there are a bunch of helper guys like that $F, and $A. See the utility page: http://www.prototypejs.org/api/utility and Enumerable objects are very powerful: http://www.prototypejs.org/api/enumerable
an addition... if you have root access but not the oracle user, login as root then "su - oracle" and follow Paul's instructions. Also try all the default oracle passwords. Last option is to look at OUTLN and DBSNMP accounts and Oracle hacks around that.

JavaFX looks like a really sweet technology, but unfortunately it's come about 5 years too late to make a difference in applet popularity.  Still, should make desktop Swing development interesting again.

Didn't work for me unfortunately. I've tried opening and closing itunes several times to make sure nothing else is attempting to use itunes, then I run my script with your lines above and quit with the same results.
VERSION THAT WORKS WITHOUT JAVASCRIPT How about if you did this with ASP, etc. and had a timestamp for when the form page was loaded and then compared that to the time when the form was submitted.  If ElapsedTime<10 sec then it's likely spam.
I don't see the relation (apart from the title). Question 44905 is about the origins of certain limitations. This question is about how to overcome one specific limitation (that isn't even mentioned in the other question).
True. I would go for Javascript any day myself.
From this am I correct to assume I can select all the rows if I class them with _highlightable_ and calling $$('.highlightable').each()?
scripts that work straight up on the command line in Linux do tend to pop up the cmd window in Windows.  I just experienced this pleasure for the first time yesterday.
As long as your xml schema is set to the schema file, it should validate it automatically and any error will be detected.  You'll get the benefit of XML intellisense as well if you have a schema associated with the xml.
Sorry, I didn't quite complete my explanation. ColorIndex specifies an index value into the current colour palette, so you will need another worksheet formula to count how many CellColor functions return 55.
I use my script everyday and I don't get that message.  Do you have any other utilities that access iTunes?  Do you use any other iTunes objects?  Maybe you need to reboot to get it cleaned up once you have gotten that message?
depending on the language, in C# for things like this, you can use labeled break instead of goto, which is the same thing I guess.
If you want to point out that there is a problem with the title, then perhaps you shouldn't add a tag `duplicate` but either change the title or explicitly mention that you think there is a problem it.
Do yo mean:  response.Filter = new MyRewriterStream(response.OutputStream)  ??
nevermind, you were right... it just looked like a typo.  That did it!
I should have clarified I wanted to use the IDE and not code.
he's passing the smtp server into the constructor of SmtpClient.
Sorry, got that error using JQuery $.ajax on FireFox 3.  Tried jsonp suggestion but I think that will only work with something that will serve up json. I'm trying to create a sample local html file based mashup that will pull data from Yahoo!Finance, but they are serving .csv, so I think I'm SOL.
I'd serialize it to a byte[] using a ByteArrayOutputStream. It would be a lot faster than writing it out to a file.
This is not a good solution, as you never know when a garbage collect will happen, or how much extra memory will be allocated to the heap at once.
Aren't the sizes of various primitives defined in the Java Specification? (§2.4.1)
That is true, and I wouldn't intend this to address the main question of this post, but it might help him to know programmatically when he is getting somewhat close to hitting the max heap size.
Not in the sense of "how much memory does it occupy," which is the question.  Only in the sense of how they operate.  For example, bytes, chars, and shorts take up an entire word on the Java stack, even though they operate with rounding etc..
Yes, Dan, that's pretty much the situation--actually there are multiple levels of security involved but I take your point.  That's a great suggestion.  Thanks.
count me in, I want to change my config files and not check them in, but they still need in the repo and need changing when I get the ticket for fixing a thing in there.
I hadn't noticed the warning before.  I wonder why Microsoft would consider deprecating such a simpler helper ... fortunately they have a good track record for backwards compatibility.
at least upgrade, lateral movement not gonna do you any good, I agree with chris
A one line function like that can be done as a lambda: is_palindrome=lambda s:s == s[::-1]
In whatever language that is, why not just do  "return StringReverse(originalString)==originalString"
I hate to bash CVS, but DON'T switch to CVS.  No!  On the other hand, it IS better than SourceSafe.  If you're going through the pain, do what Chris suggests.
But isn't the lexing completely unambiguous?
Really? For what programming-specific tasks is this required?
It will error out on ambiguity, so yes.  Being greedy or non-greedy doesn't make you ambiguous.  Greediness is actually a way to resolve ambiguity.  You also get into the interaction between the lexer and the parser in this case, so maybe it's the parser that's not greedy.
I thought about that. Then thought about PhotoSynth. That's got to be some heavy image processing, although static images...
Not sure I agree with "FAR away from the comfort of modern Outlook" or "vastly inferior to conventional Office suites".  I gave up MS Office a couple years ago for OpenOffice, and I've now given that up for Google docs.  I've never looked back. I've not once wished for MS Office
Resource intensive tasks are perfect for the cloud as you can distribute the processing across hundreds or thousands of nodes
Why make a function at all, when you can just do "is_palindrome = s == s[::-1]"? ;)
The reason you would want to do this is that the built-in regex validator will also automatically validate client-side with javascript  for you.  So if they fail validation, you save a postback.
Joel, thanks for clarifying my choice!  Regarding comments: yes, I think it'd be nice if the first few on each answer were expanded by default. Or at least highlighted a little more.
Unfortunately this regex isn't matching correctly, I'll play with it to see if I can get it to work though. Thanks!
The extra postback is irrelevant in this case but I think I'll see if I can get the regex working anyways. Thanks!
funny! I hope it's just for the warning :)
I always wanted to use Win-D more, but it's a one way action.  There doesn't seem to be a way to restore all the windows to the state they were at, unfortunately.
Anders Sandvig: for readability? And perhaps ease of maintenance in case we decide to ignore whitespace and punctuation as Dave Webb has done?
IMO, default shortcut of Launchy sucks because Alt-Space is too useful for me to let L to hi-jack it. So, I re-map Launchy to Win-Space. What is your preference?
@Zigdon: Win-D is a toggle. Press it again and the windows should be restored. Are you confusing this with Win-M? (I use XP)
It is - Win-D. At least on XP.  Another way is to use Win-M to minimize, Win-Shift-M to undo.
The Rob Conery screencasts are provided on the ASP.NET MVC website.
I'm curious why you added the # prompt.  Normally, that prompt indicates the root or superuser.  In generally, I'd think stuff like trying out the **cut** command would be better done as a regular user.  I'd have used the $ prompt.
Agreed.  I used to tutor intro CS courses and it took me awhile to realize that some students were having problems grasping this.  It's such a natural thing for most of us to process that it's difficult at first to believe that some don't.
alt space is fine by me, win-space woudl be harder to hit, but to each his own!
$ for d in one two three; do echo $d; done | tac three two one  Superflous \n. But it's cool to learn about tac.
Just downloaded WinSplit - wowza that's useful!
@Anders - Proving proofs in the case of algorithm development.
thanks for taking the time. I had not seen any unexpected values in my path, and I suspect the issue may only crop up with certain names. In this case the problem was with the non-existence of a folder ending in /profile   Surprisingly Mr Owens suggestion was bang on the button!
Check out the comment Michael left for Sam Wessel below.
Some of the information is, but they do keep it updated as the new bits come out.  There have been quite of few videos released in the past month or so.
Also, some of the links in the question he referred to has Scott Guthrie's blog in it.
I use UltraMon at home and work. Don't know how people live without it, really.  lol.  Can be a bit flaky at times when using the Smart Taskbar, but works well enough and often enough for me to stick with it.  -- Kevin Fairchild
So I need exactly the same DLL (same version? same build?), right?
The default is the order the file system returns them in. If you're using NTFS, they will be alpha sorted, but if you're using FAT32, they will be returned in table order (i.e., more or less order of creation).
No LINQ in .Net2.0, but the still the best answer so far.
I don't think it is a server.  I think it runs on a workstation.
Correct, it is meant to run on a user's workstation and therefore I do not want to change any system settings. But good thought.
And I still use Word to write my Blog Posts :-) MS Office 2007 is actually quite good, but it's overkill for small lists and documents, yet in my corporate environment it's lightyears ahead of Google Docs. OpenOffice is also a good alternative, that then depends.
My bad. I knew that. Really. :-)
see my edit, it does not, is this something strange about how MbUnit does things?
I think the reason you don't see much about it on the net is because it's so simple to use. Check the mailing list, or drop by the irc channel if you want to see how active the community around it is. #stripes on freenode
How come?  fullPath would be "C:\projects\myapplication\daotests\bin\Debug\daotests.dll"  theDirectory would be "C:\projects\myapplication\daotests\bin\Debug"  Isn't that what you want?
Ahh, no I get you. MSTest does the same thing - everything is copied to a new temp directory every time.
Set the xml files to be content, copied with the dll, or resources, read from the dll.
You must be relatively junior - who needs Visual Studio? I have the CLR running in my head. J/K
What is the context of this question? Are you using XML-RPC directly?
You might be surprised what languages are used for full-blown applications.
Are you talking about ASP.NET or Windows Forms or . . . ?
don't forget that one usually want's an case-insensitive string comparison!
s/strspn\\([^)]+\\)/strcspn(teststring + i, " \t\r\n\f")/
HA! the one character typo strikes again :(
there should be two underscores before and after "init" and "all".  I can't seem to get them to display properly :(
Perfect answer.  I hope others add to it.
Yes, you need the same DLL, but you can copy it FROM the GAC to your original path and it should get removed. with gacremove
That's actually a pretty cool Podcast. I like those "chaotic" ad-hoc ones.
The grammar may be ambiguous, but the lexer is absolutely not. The spacing makes the lexer completely well defined.
I agree with you.  I never said the lexer is ambiguous.
May want to indicate this is SQL Server 2005 or above only.
agreed. database bound menus are going to be soooo much nicer.
I know I can write an app. I mentioned it in the question :) Editing values in the table view directly has its benefits. If I can do it for numbers and strings, I would like to do it for XML too.
Don't feel like looking it up now, but I know oracle 10g has With clauses, I wonder if this is possible there too.
I purposely wanted to avoid Grails, they'd already been presented a Grails talk, I wanted to do a strictly Groovy talk.  Thanks for the input though.
Looking at the disassembled code (check my post), you are right in a way.
I use firstNameLabel and firstNameTextBox
That's a great suggestion maccullt.  Thanks; a table driven technique may be the best way to approach this problem.
Is there an off-by-one error here?  The first comparison is between letters[0] and letters[letters.Length-0], shouldn't the latter be letter[letters.Length-1]?
Daren, LINQ to SQL will be transformed to SQL query. Dictionary will be useful when iterating over objects collection.
SM_CXEDGE and SM_CYEDGE are the window border widths. I'm looking for the internal leading and trailing padding in each table cell in a ListView control that's in "Report View" mode. Or am I missing something?
Note: in .NET 3.5 JavaScriptSerializer is marked as obsolete, it says to use DataContractJsonSerializer
I don't think this can be it as it's a dynamic cropping based on the largest string in the List and not a static cut-off point.
Ah, I see.  Very strange problem.  Is the join column of "note" the actual note id or the actual note?
Can you include what you are exactly trying to do, e.g., what code have you tried using that hasn't worked?
Thx! that works like a charm ... also i tried to add  link http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Cookies.html "docs" but that may have failed
`var` isn't magical. You can do this just as well in C# 2.0. Ask the for the type of `myObject` and `obj` and you'll see they're nothing special. `var` is not dynamic - it is static.
It is, but it removes the requirement for you to specify the type that you need, as opposed to typing MyObjectA myObject in myObjectsList.
Sure they do: "//(where OtherObjectA implements IOtherObjects)"
It should be noted that "Boost Logging v2" is not part of boost, but a proposed library that may or may not be accepted when it comes up for review.
John, Probably in this concrete case when ToList implementation is the same for both classes compiler could be a bit more intelligent. But it's the way it is, you should use standard means - interfaces or inheritance from base class.
They do what? MyObjectA and MyObjectB are different classes. ToList is a part of abstract class. Please read question carefully before making such comments.
Its true the hardware load balancer could be set to sticky sessions to solve the issue, but in a perfect world, I would like the feature turned off.
Good answer, but in this case I wouldn't dare ask for elevation. What's the point of security if every app asks for special privileges?
Why not just move the mouse 1 pixel as @Keng mentioned? This seems like it would drive the user nuts.
The 'Note' column is the id of the note from the Note table yeah.
His concern (I thought) was when he had a *collection* of MyObject<?>s, not a single MyObject<Whatever>.
if a long time is 10-15 years, I agree. But it will happen.
In all, I have to agree. This is just bad design.
Its good to have the answer here even though it is discoverable on Google. It helps Stack Overflow become a more comprehensive repository of programming answers so I'm going to mod up this question.
I think I would third this.. If my latest response is correct, I would not be happy with the design of it.
Recursive backtracker generates a pretty river-y solution, as noted. Of perhaps more interest is Eller's Algorithm, which has nice properties similar to the random algorithms (that give good river-y solution percentages and dead-end percentages) but runs waay faster.
To make it work with zeros just add: while (num >>= 1 && num)
Is this kind a bug or feature?
Ahh, yes, of course. VB supports inline XML - I'm still not sure of the benefit of mixing data and code like that.
Re: Visual Studio saving files in all-lowercase  Which version of Visual Studio are you using?  Last I checked this seemed to be better in the 2008 version.  In 2005 the bug seemed to occur when files were opened via the debugger instead of solution explorer.
Levenshtein's distance (already being used) is a better algorithm here than a phonetic one like soundex, which also only looks at the start of a word.
I have bands list, I'm ignoring them in keywords.
So Daren, is there a way to make module_importer import the right variable dynamically based on some environment variable etc.
Subject line doesn't, but the osx tag does.
I would like input on this as well, especially from a cakephp perspective.
Visio has some kind of events at the "package" level. A package can contain multiple classes.. each of which can contain multiple events potentially. This link doesn't seem to correspond to a representation of .Net events.
You might want to elaborate a bit. What is quickly? Are there any limits on the (size of) the substring you'll look for? Does the file contain one big string or several smaller ones that need to be searched separately? Disk size? "Minimal" memory usage?
What's the error that's thrown? There's no SharePoint in this code... is that true of your current production code?
True, it is inconvenient to grant privileges for minor tasks. But if you wrap pmset in a suid script, that could solve the problem (the script can be executed as root without prompting). Of course, suid scripts can be potential security holes...
Hi alastairs, I realize that you have a point here.   But I am creating the wrapper dll as a test assembly to test the logic inside my exe. Therefore I have no choice :)
... as long as you don't filter (WHERE) on a column with no index and use no joins :)
Wow, that's confusing. It turns out that using "git diff HEAD..branch" shows all commits (x, y, z, c, d, e), but "git log HEAD..branch" does exactly what I want and only shows x, y, z! This is the exact opposite of using "...".
IDEs are one of the first things I'd want on the net. NetBeans, for instance, already has some collaboration features. It'd great to be WebStartable. Just launch the app from any (safe) machine and get to work with colleagues.
You can also do CPU intensive tasks in runtimes such as the JRE. Not everything needs be ECMAScript.
Hi Espo,  your suggestion was great. But maybe what I was looking for was a bit different. I have edited my question to be more explicit.
I must say I'm surprised, but it seems to me you are correct in assuming the table data is not read from disk. Still, are you certain that it's the aggregation part, rather than the retrieval part? I. e., do you get a speed gain if you do a simple SELECT * and aggregate the rows in the program?
Tried rebooting, upgrading to iTunes 8.0. No other iTunes objects running - just a simple reboot, open itunes, run script, close powershell, close itunes, warning message appears.
Operating system? Do you need to regexp in the search string or are you looking for whole string matches?
What's the security reason involved with using eval?
Great answer but probably worth put a link to Jargon file entry: http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/F/foo.html
I don't have any .rc files, can you give me a sample one so that I can create a regex for it?
No need to screen-scrape - just use the RenderControl function to an HtmlWriter.
The System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement namespace is new to .NET 3.5, isn't it?
Thanks, sounds great, but we unfortunately only have VIM 6.1 installed on the server.
Earlier version of the website asserted that it could be done.  Not using .NET but by using the javascript files directly.

The 'join' query is much, much faster than the one with 'select' embedded in where ('join' does one extra select, 'where' does one for every entry!). Could you edit your anwser to indicate this?
Well, you have to add an index if performance requires it. If it's ten stocks and a year's daily data, I wouldn't be concerned: MySQL is relatively good at table scanning.
Exactly my thoughts on this one Sam!
Please check Adam Mitz comment bellow. I still found this answer the best because of simplicity. However someone should concern.
If he had few data he wouldn't be asking for an efficient way to do this, no? Even the first, obvious approach would be enough.
Or if Javascript is being used somehow to alter the user input for GUI purposes. I came across an XSS vulnerability that, at first, encoded <> to < and >... but when passed to this function, they were replaced again! So... there goes your XSS prevention, I guess. :)
I have played with CC.NET, I had to do a large number of source edits the developers assumed only one VOB (source database) on the ClearCase plugin.
Don't be so sure :) I saw some really weird compilers for embedded software development.
i use intergraph's api, and the reason is that the api isn't well designed and built. so i'm extracting the non-gis properties into c# classes to be used in application for drop down lists, checklists and things like that. for the map rendering, the intergraph's api is used.
In embedded systems, almost all conventional wisdom ends. ;-)
This algorithm always returns the expected number of responses, but it usually won't fit them exactly between the start and end dates, I'm not sure this is possible unless I manually mess with the frequencies?
Yes I am using TCP, but it's on the localhost.  Also simple queries can execute very fast, between 15-60 ms.
That is very smart, I will try to do that.   Now I wonder if my old cookie-based account could be merged with my new OpenId-based account so I can mark this answer as THE answer...
Well unfortunately, this is function is going to be used in some functional tests as well so I'd love to keep it all in family as much as possible.  Maybe simulation is a better description than load testing
This is a good idea in general but in my case I want to handle the "raw" RPC results first in the "data access" object and then pass these handled results on to the caller (the command object), which is why I'm currently using the AsyncTokens to keep the references to the callba
Further refinement here... I do not have the source, it's not my application.
That's why it's a tough problem. I have an existing GUI app (sans source) that I need to run as a service.
@skolima: How would you suggest that I replace the subquery with a join. I don't think that that's possible, because I need a aggregate function "in the middle".
Sorry, I am drawing a blank here. This would be an excelent SO question though: "How to dynamically find out if we are running Jython, CPython or IronPython?". Then, you could just do it in ifs...
If "everybody" knows this, why are so many people asking about the meaning of "foo", "bar" and "foobar"? Prakash is not the first person to ask.  IMO foo, bar and foobar are not intuitive, like a, b, c, tmp, X, Y, Z, var and func, which is why I think many pe

Before you notice any changes svn will gladly merge your files. Anyway it's a good idea to check what changed :-)
I like this answer but without knowing the size of stack up front I've got no way of telling if I'm about to blow it up.
try this one: http://www.absint.com/stackanalyzer/ i dont use GCC so I really cant answer but thought the link might be what you are after.
Nice example, but make the naming a bit more .NETy and call it "CreateAbstractClass(string args)" for coding-standards sake :)
BLOB is a Oracle term, not a Microsoft SQL Server term. Refer to the specific column type to get a better answer (such as 'text' or 'image').
I agree. What you are getting is only the client side library. But, the real productiviy benefits comes in using the server side controls.
moving it one pixel isn't noticable to anyone but cyborgs and cyborgs just devnull frustration anyway so your all good.
Thanks for the good answer.  Using this info, at least I can manually set some programs to launch in a particular place, if I want to.
Render control will give you perfect HTML this is that is the solution.
It also appears that pressing CTRL+O enough times will also start taking you back through previously opened files.
A (not great) example would be:  void subroutine(int i) {   char foo[20000];   i++;   if (i < 1000) subroutine(i); }
Ctrl+O is my preferred method also.  I use it constantly and wish other editors replicated its behavior.
That works for everything? The only thing i know of that it works for is the build, well at least that is what it works for according to MS.
Snippets work well for situation and save typing.  For example I have created custom snippets because I am replacing some old code in files, and I can't use copy replace, so I can highlight the old code, and then use my snippet.
I picked yours as the "answer" b/c I have never heard of the ctrl-scroll lock, scroll lock one before.
Yes, CTRL-O and CTRL-I seem to take you back and forth where you've been, nice.
With CTags, Ctrl+T will take you back... don't know how it is different from Ctrl+O.
Also, the Ctrl2Cap utility from Microsoft works well.  (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897578.aspx)
If Powershell stays open then you get the message.  From the powershell command line I tried doing "powershell .\scriptname.ps1" and the script ran against powershell left me at the powershell command line and I didn't get the message when exiting iTunes.  I'll edit my answer.
If I recall correctly, the start- and end-of-pattern symbols (the '|'s) are required in the PHP preg_* functions.
There will be a default size of the stack for threads on your system.  In Windows this is 1MB of address space.  You can control this if you are creating your own threads.    Though as Skizz points out it would be best not to have to worry about the exact limit!
This will only work for C/C++ Projects.  It does not have an option for C#.
$itunes.quit() unfortunately would close itunes, not always something I'd want to do. The powershell <script> by bruceatk worked for me though so thanks for replying.
Yeah cool, and thanks for your suggestions.  Scanning the csproj will only work if the references exist already, which they don't in my case.  And scanning the DLL using a tool like depends.exe is no better than using source insight.  Thanks anyway.
That's the way I've done it at first, but later realized that I would like to use for each on this object to get to the values.
Also with the powershell <script> method the ::releaseobject calls doesn't seem to be needed.
Yep, I misread your question, I apology. Did you try to analyze dependencies in run-time using Dependency Walker?
to use foreach on an object the only requirement is that it has a publi  GetEnumerator() method that returns and IEnumerator, the object doesn't even have to implement any interface at all but it's recomended that you do implement IEnumerable or IEnumerable<T>, you can guess why ;)
I've run into these before as custom jobs. I think it's tough because you need so much context (US vs. UK, volume vs. mass vs. liquid vs. density etc. to do conversions properly.
haha...good point.  i never realized that it was so explicate myself!
That's what I thought, so my error is elsewhere than. Thanks for reassurence.
You're right, that's not a good example. What I really wanted to know was what you were doing with the 20k array.
I like it, I think this would work for my situation, I have to check into Postgres support or MV, it does look a little less solid than Oracle's.  This is probably 75% of the answer, but I still wonder if it's possible to speedup the live aggregate query.
This is going to be slower, as you instantiate an extra empty list unnecessarily.

Using JPA, and @PersistenceContext to get the EntityManager - but it seems we need @PersistenceUnit for an EntityManagerFactory and to refresh the data, we get a new EntityManager.  Sounds fine - but heavy handed way to get things updated, but if thats what people do...
Explanation of Honeypot Captcha (which looks very good): Bots love forms. They fill out all the fields. A honeypot Captcha includes a field that is HIDDEN by CSS so only the bots (and those with IE 3.0) see it. If it's filled, it's a bot. Very easy to implement.
Hi Tom - Sorry, I don't quite understand - What do you mean by "First find your k random numbers". The objective is to find the k random numbers taken from the list - or am I misunderstanding something.
Note that strtok modifes the string you're checking, so you can't use it on const char * strings without making a copy.
Good point.  The library was reviewed 2/4/2008-2/13/2008 and apparently rejected.  It may be reviewed again.  Probably log4cxx or log4cpp are the best bets.
Yes, but flickr uses document.write in their API, and I really need the content at the location of the script. I cannot change the API, and changing the element written to won't solve the problem.
We are using a custom Principal and Identity object.
Well, I know that I can inject specific ID attributes into specific page elements that get rendered, and that the HTML source is otherwise unlikely to change in any meaningful way.  You have a good point, but with this particular 3rd-party app, I think this aspect of it is relatively safe.
We are using a custom Principal and Identity object.
Track Active Item in Solution Explorer is one of the features I regret are not on by default. So many people have gasped in wonder as I check the box and show them what it does.
You could do that, but I didn't need to. I just posted the code I'm using. It took me like 2 minutes to write, and I haven't needed to change it. If you want to post a modified version to move it one pixel that would be cool.
reeeehhhheeeheeallly?  I've just been itching to use F#.
Grab aku's POST info and edit the answer -- I don't have 2k rep yet :)
This is the key thing--MS has the ability to push it out there. Since their OS still has an astoundingly large chunk of the market share, they should be able to get it out into the wild with ease.
Aku,  unfortunately those links refer to the command line, I am unable to use those as we do not have direct access to the command line.    If I were to encrypt it on my own machine and then deploy it to the server it will not work as the key will not exist/be different
Actually you need an if to check for zero. Since ret starts at 1 and grows, this algorithm won't make it hit 0, the answer for the input of 0.
Why does this not help you then? CurrentPrincipal will return the custom principal object...
This is exactly the sort of thing that's gotten Microsoft into trouble in the past.  Using their OS to leverage their way into a new marketplace is the kind of thing that will land them in court for another decade.
I'm not really sure what you are asking, maybe you could clarify?
As a service you may not have a user logged in to the machine therefore no desktop.
Actually, it's more for things like a Gas Mileage tracker.  I don't have the graphics skills to do good games.

The multithreading issue is that strtok uses a global variable to keep track of where it is, so if you have two threads that each use strtok, you'll get undefined behavior.
I am not sure if it does, I will check into that.  That may be the solution I need.
or even better yet, a butcher knife when you are trying to spread butter.
Good question but it's a little too vague for a reasonable answer without discussion.  This is why the top answer is a simple 'Yes'.
@Andrew Very good point about the static UrlBuilder instance. I shall pray for forgiveness to the gods of multi-threading.
This doesn't work, as it tries to find an element with the ID of the hash, not an anchor with the NAME attribute.
This is great - you also might want to select the parent element of the anchor, rather than the anchor itself however.
"object orientate" isn't correct usage.  "object orient" is correct.  "orientate" is not a word.
I have really small data. But I dont use local access. I used this datapump dll and HTTP access.

The HTML has all the styling in on each element.  That is because if you view it in Outlook on preview and I had css styling at the top you would see the styling.  So I put them all on the elements to prevent that.

Yep, that's the best way of doing it in my book.
What would the LDAP connection string look like if you point it to the domain and not the server?
Also, we aren't 'replacing' an element in a list. We're copying the first (r-1) elements and putting the new value in r, where it's cdr is connected to the (r+1) element --since we are dealing with persistence.
Your solution is O(N) in space instead of required O(1).
O(1) in space means in-place (plus any additional amount of memory if it does not grow with N).
I was afraid of that, although I've subclassed ADMP before and it wasn't too bad. I am curious if there is an answer to what the LDAP string would look like if pointing to the domain rather than the server.
It does not meet the requirement of O(1) in space (Number of words is O(N))
DecimalFormat is available in jdk 1.4.
There has been a long discussion about this (did NBC or NFL make the decision) in the Advanced Streaming Media list, and the consensus seems to be that it was the NFL's call.  NBC was out of the loop.  The interesting question was "Did Adobe pay for the privilege?"

I would completely agree with you, but I have been told this is what I am stuck with.

Keith is spot on. The 4 Guys article previously referenced even ends with: "After my exhaustive search I found that there is still no way of truly disabling the back button for all cases." Doh! I don't need to read two articles to read that last!
I cannot remember the cache size of either disk.
Yep, I'm not showing the other service. It creates its own host like the one shown.
I believe the read/write swap was occurring because of the sounds the disks were making.
I thought an RS always gets closed when the PS that created it is closed.
Yep,I already thought about that too, but I tough it could be done with Java only. And I think I would be better to use "ps -aux" instead of top. Thanks for the quick answer!
I don't understand what you mean by "get" data. Doesn't the fact that you have access to the rptrFollowUpSummary mean that you already have the data in its raw form?
Every LDAP connection string I have ever seen contained the server then you would supply the domain which to authenticate on.
Servers will be spread out over the internet, so the session solution is not what I want... The forbidden access is also one solution that I had in mind and I might go with it, because cookies will probably cause too much trouble.
Going through a PHP file is not really what I want. Thought about that, but I prefer to let apache handle the transfers. What I might do is set up "temporary symlinks" to the downloads through a php file if everything is okay (website was viewed).

Fair enough. Sorry I couldn't be a better help.
Oh, yeah - good point. I must admit, I was logged in as root at the time and simply went for it - a bad habit, I know. Having said that, I think echo and cut are two of the least harmful commands :) But, for the sake of completeness, I'll certainly update the example right away. Cheers.
I still disagree - I approach this question semantically. Maybe there are some technical differences, but semantically, they are not. Structs are really useful for creating value types, classes are not.
What flavor of Unix is this? and which mail version? Just to know where that doesn't work.
Agreed.  But let's assume the customer wants the best quality their agreed-upon budget can get them, AND they want an RSS feed reader.
Sorry, I realize my example wasmisleading.
Amen - not very clear about what he is after...
Perforce proxy isn't quite what I'm looking for - I want to maintain a private repository for intermediate checkins.  I guess ideally we should be using branches here, but that's not really an option.
Yes, of course a customer wants the best quality possible for a given budget.  That kind of misses the point: the budget is driven by the actual value of that quality.  That's why military systems are expensive, and consumer systems aren't (relatively speaking), for instance.
...and similarly, the value of the world's best RSS feed reader is almost zero, which is why very few people are willing to pay for one, regardless of how good it is.
Um, almost all.  Anyone using mailx or berkeley mail is going to see it that way.  If you want to affect the header, write the whole header and send with rmail or sendmail directly.
Any input welcome - doesn't matter if I pick it or not ;) (The main problem with your solution is that I have to deal with downloads with hundreds of MBs. It would be a pain in the a** to implement "resumeable downloads" - not even talking about the memory usage for such huge files).
Oh, but, sorry, I run GenToo.
I do want to give the UI developer the opportunity to handle this specific error ... so I'm going to create my own exception type.
*Cough* I am not sure I would defend anything using MySpace as an example.
Please tell us more about what you're trying to accomplish, including why you can't split on spaces.  Then we can tailor our answers to your situation.
For the record, I'm using mailx and the example Chris gives works. Or is that what you meant?
Yeah, I saw nmodbus and it looked ok, but last time I tried it it was a bit rough around the edges. I will give it a try.  Really, I am now interested in reading up on WSD. Thanks for the link!
I believe that this method will cause a warning in some IDEs, such as IntelliJ, because you're creating an exception but not throwing it.  I recommend the Thread.getStackTrace() method which has the same logic but it's hidden from the developer.
That'll work for Strings, but not for mutable objects.  You'll want to clone those as well.
Yeah, his question is for strings.  And he has the problem of generics which don't really like the casting stuff in this case.
Sure thing.  WSD is really the way to go.  Modbus is a very old protocol, I know you may not have a choice, but devices of today are starting to target WSD.
No, this is a valid question.  Java does not support "true" generics, with runtime type erasure and all, so these kinds of details can be tricky.  Furthermore, the Cloneable interface and the Object.clone() method mechanism is similarly confusing.
OK, I mostly do C# where this is really easy. Please let me know if you want me to remove the comments from this question.
The problem with referrer checking is, that there are many "referrer blockers", so you have to allow requests with an empty referrer. Also: The referrer will not always be the same, but that's just a matter of "regexp".
Also, ArrayList.clone will only do a shallow clone, so mutable objects in the list won't be cloned using that method either.
You can leave the comment.  I think my edits explained what I was having trouble with.
Your comment is OK, if a bit condescending.  I imagine a lot of hoops that Java developers have to jump through seem silly to .NET developers.
Reflection is of course not an asp.net hidden feature... and yes, the question is meant to be all encompassing...
This will work fine for Strings (which is what the question asked for), but it is worth noting that ArrayList.clone will perform a shallow copy, so if there were mutable objects in the list, they will not be cloned (and changing one in one list will change that one in the other list as well.
HttpModules is something that is advanced, but I wouldn't call it rare or less used (or call me naive). But yes, I love the architecture.
Thanks for reinforcing my suspicion that closures would just be syntactic sugar for anonymous inner classes.
Thread.dumpStack() is easier if you just want to send it to stderr (saves having to loop over the stack trace elements yourself).
I am not sure what you would define by a 'hidden feature' then. You might think of adding an example of what you consider a hidden feature.
I tend to doubt referrer blockers are common outside a very, very small techie demographic.  Depending on the type of files you're providing, it may be a demographic you can afford to ignore. Varying referrers is easy, as you say - a quickie regular expression and you're all set.
Actually, I need Javascript for all sorts of other bits of the page.
The base access engine is included with Windows.
agreed Keith. We've been through roughly the same situation at my work and after a long time we realized it would have been easier to refactor the application to not need the back button disabled.
They don't want to run that on their customer's machines, because that will disable _any_ application from using the dialog.  They just want to prevent _their_ application from sending it.
Well I don't know a way to get totally rid of subquery. However, in your "update complex response", the subquery gets executed once. In your first query, the subquery is called as many times as there are items in `Thing`. At least on MySQL.
Please see http://beta.stackoverflow.com/questions/53670/how-to-efficiently-sql-select-neweset-entries-from-a-mysql-database (duplicate of this question).
Vinko, what version of UN*X are you running?  Do you mean by "works" that you get his results or that you get the desired behavior that would address his need?  It depends in some degree on how message submission works on your platform  and whether the client adds a blank line before the
this method (base 62) is superior than the GUID(base 16) on strength: an 8-char hex string is equivalent to a 4-5 char alphanumeric one
Very good point and thanks for the comment/answer transition.  The server is ours and it is limited to our apps.  The fact that something is crashing somewhere outside of our core apps bothers us but it's too expensive to try to track down to find out it's some bizarre minesweeper function. 80)
I would disagree with the 'This includes pretty much every web site ever created.' comment.  If the website are high load you are correct.  Trac for instance uses SQLite by default and performs very nicely out of the box for small teams.
The downside is that dumpStack() only goes to stderr, and you can't send it somewhere else like you can with an exception or Thread.getStackTrace().
My understanding is that this is a cross team problem. If that is the case then unless there is cross team code review I'm not sure that this solution would work. Even with cross team review, why wouldn't the other team do the same thing and force the OP to use their library?
I meant, reflection is not specific to asp.net. It is something that you can use even outside of asp.net (for example, in a win forms application)
Thanks Judah. I guess I thought the directions for the replacement were on the lifehacker article :)
Jeff V: Interesting fact about math: x * 7 == x + (x * 2) + (x * 4), or x + x >> 1 + x >> 2.  Integer addition is usually pretty cheap.
I'm not entirely convinced that existing chat bots even have such a thing as 'state.'  Their responses seem to be dependent only upon the very last question you asked.  It's just coincidence that humans will ask a series of related questions.
Does this have to be done in SQL Server? It's not something I would associate with a database server, but something done by form validation or even a view.
Give it time: you'll have two developer access the same field at the same time and it'll choke.
With the new information that there essentially is cross team review, trying to enforce a specific library might work, but I think only **after** a standard is settled on.
Seriously, that mustache is too cool :)
*Cough* MySpace may suck as a place for social networking (as they say, it is the trailer park of social networks), but it *does* have a lot of traffic and seems to handle it quite well, regardless of what you think of it.
I have now added a sample of how you can output your required key/value.
I think it's shoe polish.... That was one wild night.
Is it for launching externally in Acrobat or you need a design time control for displaying inside the application?
Visual Studio took several minutes to open a table with 600,000 rows, which is actually a little slower than SSMS. And the filtering is cumbersome compared to Access. Thanks anyway for the suggestion.
I would have voted this up, but ran out of votes. I am going to try and remember to come back to vote this up. I didn't know that we could have the same Code Behind file for multiple pages. Not sure, how that would work.
This method is useful in JavaME which doesn't have getStackTrace or dumpStack methods on Thread.
Actually yes this is 2005. No chance of an upgrade for a while though.
This is most likely a feature. The slug is ignored when server is deciding which question to show. The question is fetched solely based on its id (47427 in this case).
no idea why this has been downvoted, seems a reasonable question to me
'cause i used a shorter type name. Think of all the time you wasted typing those extra five characters... ;-p
That's exactly what I was looking for.  We have vendor config files where we have to add a bunch of custom properties.  Ideally we would like to automate this rather than hand edit it everytime.  Thanks!
He just completely changed the question. He needs to close this and ask a new one if that's what he wants to do. He ripped out his entire example, as well.
By doing this you won't have intellisense and can only access the properties of items through reflection.
Why don't you return Diction<K,V>?
i'm not sure what the proper protocol is here on stackover flow, but if that's what i should do i'll do that
the meat of the question was:  s it possible to write a function in a way where invalid arguments or non existent variables can be passed in and php will not error without the use of '@' which is the same. I answered the question as was worded, and my answer will work for the old wording or the new
Be aware that the query has not running yet.
What do you define as choke?  from your response I am guessing you do not have much experience with SQLite.  SQLite will lock the entire file on operations so you might experience a delay, but it is near impossible to have it 'choke' in the situation you proposed.
Yes I just noticed this..I don't have intellisense.  There must be a better way.
*settles back in anticipation*..!  If you need the output to be a clue for the original phrase, I don't really see how you could 'generate' it.  Surely all you can do is generate a list of phrases/anagram pairings and pick from them?  How could an algorithm understand astronomers=moon starers, eg?
Why do the passwords need to be completely unique?
Are you interested in using a framework or libraries, or are you just interested in knowing how to implement a custom caching solution?
It is a good approach, but you cannot use it for a signed assembly.
i still get a undefined error: Notice: Undefined variable: var2 in file.php on line 19
You can actually just say "for key in sorted(d):" without having to say "d.keys()" since iterating over a dictionary just iterates over its keys.
this was just a simple example.  I have a lot more values that I'm actually selecting that don't fit into a dictionary
Of course generating GOOD anagrams is a hard problem, but generating bad anagrams is easier :)
MySpace has people adding and reading rapidly all day long. It isn't just a "serve pages and scrabulous" application.
@Paul Glad it worked for you.. I gave up on Itunes a long time ago :)
It seems like this (along with Jimmy's answer) would only work for a single word anagram -- how can this be applied to anagrams of phrases?
And he expanded the "// ..."s as well... Nonetheless I feel I should accept the first one. Sorry Andrew!
Can you update your post with the purpose of doing this?  I assume it's for performance, but trying to optimize a file's location on the disk seems a bit over the top to me.  If you clarify what you're trying to do maybe there is another approach we can offer that will solve your problem.
One could argue that relying on your logic code to run a function is obscure and your logic should be designed to not rely on that for clarity and maintainability.
An interesting thought.  I took the approach of connecting using POP3 so that my code would work in a shared-hosting environment where you don't have full control over how email is delivered.
THANK YOU so much for expanding on this solution.  The key was using a specific type.  This works great
It depends on your definition of better way. Lazy loading is nice for many circumstances.
buggeration - you're right :) OK this version fixes it. You have to use compact to extract the variables from out of the mix (including any fantasy ones which don't exist) but should still allow for some compact code (no pun intended)
Thanks, after using it for a couple of hours, I can say that's a great soft, definitely!
Don't forget the workaround for IE's "friendly" messages: http://tinyurl.com/app-offline-friendly
Yes, but sorted isn't available in older python (pre 2.4), so this idiom is still useful.
The fact that his name is 'Dr Unix' should imply, if anything at all, that he is well experienced in Unix, but its a stretch to think that implies any bias for or against .NET.  Just my 2 cents.
Yes, I can publish the website like that as a manual step, but I want the result of building the solution to place the deployment items in a directory with the rest of the solution build results. This also means a run of msbuild on the build machine gets me what I want.
Agreed, the Project Triangle is definitely an oversimplification on many counts.  Your point about Lean is well taken, but I think it may be worth pointing out that someone who does Lean Development well wouldn't be cheap, so you're still somewhat forced to sacrifice on the 3rd constraint (cost).
Right, and I have a powershell script that installs the website providing all the files are present in the right place. When I want to update the website I again need all the files and can xcopy deploy those.
If you want an automated build script, you should update your question.
When you update the site, what is the difference between publishing the site through VS and running your script?
Scope is a good point.  Indeed, I could quickly produce a quality piece of software that only generated prime numbers for a low cost.  Instead of 4 corners, I like to think of it in 3D - a pyramid.
I am developing web sites that are used outside of our corporate intranet - i.e. I need to take the site to a customer and install it there, or have it packaged ready for that. I also want to install an official build of the site from the build server.
Does anyone else think its a security risk to allow you to activate a trace from a url?  (#1)  I'm not going to downvote this question, but its important to understand the risk there.
Hi Rich, I'm using MSBuild already to build the project and this is triggered on every check-in by an internal system a little like CCNet. The problem is that only the assembly from the project is placed in the output directory - no .aspx files or other content - I want the content too.
Can you give us more examples and info?  It's hard to understand exactly what you're trying to do here.
This is close, but depending on your random routine only has just over microsecond accuracy.  As he mentioned, uniqid failed for the same possibility.
If you take a substring of a cryptographically secure hash then you defeat the uniqueness of the hash.  No portion of a hash is more secure or random than any other.  It is just as likely to get equal passwords as using a regular call to a random number generator.
GUID (or UUIDS) and sequences are the only two ways to avoid duplicates, but you are correct for every other algorithm mentioned here.
Not sure why you got downmodded - that's an entirely possible way of doing it.
Can you run IIS manager (Run > inetmgr) and right click the service file. Click Browse. you might get more error details if you try with localhost. Also note the url in the Browser. Maybe the website is configured for a different port.
Yes it has those features http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Controls/WinForms/Grid/dataoperations.xml
Writing fluently and educating the team is certainly a goal; however, when idioms change (for example ENV['RAILS_ENV'] == 'development' to Rails.env.development?) then these kinds of tools can be very helpful in preventing bad habits from getting a start.
As I said in the post, for multiple words you could examine all pairs, triples, etc., in each case combining the letters and sorting (and use mergesort so that op is faster!) and test against that combo.  You could be smarter still, e.g. bitfields of chars used at all and...
...obviously the total number of characters, so when I say "test all triples" there are massive categories you can prune.  For example, store words first by length, then hash.  So in your pairs/triples you're already able to skip combos with wrong numbers of characters.
If arbitrary identifier lengths are allowed, I agree.  If he wants to keep to 8 chars as in his examples, it's just not enough.
sorting the characters first doesn't help at all. It might give you one or two, but you need to test all combinations and then reject them. One way would be to generate all possible triplets and then compare them to the first three letters of all words from a dictionary.
sorting does help -- it's the simplest way (aside from say, using .NET HashSet<T> or Python set()) to map a ordered list of letters to an unordered list.
I agree for a general case, but if you're doing a one-off script to parse one or two very specific things out, a regex can just make life easier.  Obviously more fragile, but if maintainability is a non-issue then it's not a concern.  That said, BeautifulSoup is fantastic.
Why is this necessary? I highly doubt that this is the best design for whatever purpose you intend. More than likely there are other mechanisms to produce the results you desire without opening up the huge can of worms (for security and maintainability) that is evaluating code snippets at run time.
ok, fair enough, it speeds up things in that the anagrams of "foobar" and "barfoo" will resolve to the same result set, but if you are going to get all anagrams from just one sentence, then sorting doesn't help you since you need to consider all characters available.
I love regex, but have to agree with Orion on this one.  This is one of the time when the famous quote from Jamie Zawinski comes to mind: "Now you have two problems"
No, the license doesn't expire - you simply don't get updates after the subscription period is up.
its a matter of reverse lookup, too. once you have your big list of letters ("astronomers"), you find a list of sorted substrings ("mno" + "aat" + "sors", or "mnoo"+"aerrsst" for example) so you can look it up in the lookup table you gener
8 characters is enough for exactly 1,099,511,627,776 unique passwords if you use Base32, which is respectable for manually entered data (32^8)  This makes no allowance for verification, nor does it exclude patterns like 00000000.
JUnit can do the grouping thing you are talking about by defining a test suite and then adding the tests in the desired group to that suite.  You can then set up a target in your ant script that only runs that suite, and set up your source control to run that target upon checkin.
You can make it a little clearer by using BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT in place of enable_if. i.e.  BOOST_STATIC_ASSERT(boost::is_base_of<base,ImplementationClass>);
FYI: You can add them in full and specify in configuration manager for them not to build with the solution.
Yep, I've added that. I prefer enable_if as it lets you have different versions and gives slightly better error messages (IMO). Some people also like the error messages from MPL's static assert.
I prefer to use solution items, it allows me to build solution even if entlib projects missing
Collisions are due to his algorithm or his encoding (maybe only using Decimal, which is only 100,000,000 possibilities.  Centralized sequential generation is the only solution that will work, or checking for duplicates like you suggested.
A link to the video would be great.
Ben, from our test, this is true. The second equality search only runs as required. You can test it yourself by overloading the ==, !=, Equals() and GetHashCode of a certain object. I found it very interesting (but I am a geek :) )
(continued), so the knock on effect of nonunique hash codes would be slower performance to run the equality check, but in our situation where the nonunique value is very rare, it is largely insignificant
@RichB, I'm using MySpace just for the sake of its sheer traffic, and nothing else :p Get some cough syrup!
I love this solution, but it's just a little too obfuscated.  Still gets a vote as the most compact solution.
We've found that SCons is unusably slow for large Visual Studio solutions.  It works very well on UNIX-ish systems.
Just to confirm you are using C:\\so\\My[space][space]Doc.doc right?
This question is about function-scoped statics.  At least when they have nontrivial constructors they are initialized on first entry into the function.  Or more specifically, when that line is reached.
True -- but the question talks about the space allocated to the variable, and uses simple data types.  The space is still allocated in the code segment
I don't see how code segment vs. data segment really matters here.  I think we need clarification from the OP.  He did say "and initialized, if applicable".
Hey I gave that answer 1 hour befor Darren. Serves me right for not giving a sample:)
(posted here and self answered because it's helpful info assembled from various tutorials and some trial and error and (a) I want to be able to find it again and (b) others might find it handy)
The original answer included links to free VM software (Virtual Box) and free Windows disk images (from Microsoft, for web developers). While IEs4Linux is also an option, you can also run Windows in a VM without spending anything.
Manually exclude by adding the following in the <Configuration> section:   <location path="css">     <system.web>       <authorization>         <allow users="*"></allow>       </authorization>     </system.web>   </location>
This is good. Then how is it working in your production evironment? You should have the same problem there unless this section is missing in your dev web.config
I would also suggest Douglas Crockford's site as a resource on private / public methods and members http://javascript.crockford.com/private.html
Slight caution in using an initial  context thet mey be null, but otherwise great. Thanks.
He mentioned that link in the question.
The downside to this method is that you couldn't have private_stuff() access other private data in Restaurant and other Restaurant methods can't call private_stuff(). The upside is that if you don't need either of the conditions I just mentioned, you can keep use_restroom() in the prototype.
You still need to #define NOMINMAX or the preprocessor will still expand min & max.
Do not use "T" strings, chars and functions, unless you intend to do both Unicode and ANSI builds. If you only intend to do Unicode builds, just do regular wide character stuff:  L"my wide string" wcslen(L"my string")  etc
Bingo - don't store credit card data if at all possible. Process and discard, and let a service like PayPal deal with recurring transactions.
I also dislike this approach's verbosity so probably wouldn't use it in the general case.  It is nifty how it gets added to the prototype though and in JS usually performance wins out against all else.
Certainly we can turn off integration to VSS and drive it through Source Safe UI instead. Nice thought
Agree, only use _T macros if you want generic text, i.e., the ability to code for both Unicode and Ascii/MBCS.
Django does _not_ use sqlalchemy for it's ORM.  There has been some work done to make sqlalchemy an optional ORM, but it's not complete.
Sorry about that, but I promise I did search before I asked, just apparently not for the right thing.
Yes, but in that case is there a clean alternative to ClientScriptManager.RegisterClientScriptResource for CSS use?
Awkward, since I actually have to add methods to my classes but maybe. Does $a == $b implicitly get converted to strings before comparison, Because this is something I would like to do with a mocking framework so I do not have the option of running a string cast on it.
I see, thanks for the help, unfortunately I just tried this and in order for equality to be true the private variables have to contain the same values too.
What does the CompnayName.Technology buy you? I don't see any benefit into naming things this way. Any insights?
Didn't know that the Framework has such a method! Awesome! Will swap out my current code for this!
It turns out that there is support for this by the framework. So I am accepting that answer rather!
You'll need quotes around that server tag of course.  And I don't see why this is a hack.  It's a legitimate technique that I use all the time.  That's what things like server tags and ClientID are for.
If you custom draw a List-View Subitem (NM_CUSTOMDRAW), the you get an NMLVCUSTOMDRAW structure that contains a DC and bounding rect that is the entire "table cell" space from floor to ceiling and wall to wall. I want to know what padding to apply in my custom draw method so my contents a
Hello Tim, Nice to see you here! I loved PocketTunes. Kudos!!
It has been encouraged by Jeff to answer ones own questions. This is not only a query platform but a platform to find answers. Who they are coming from - who cares. Well done.
First sentence in the linked article: "Looking through some of the new 3.5 stuff I stumbled over a new assembly named "System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement" - that caught my attention."
I disagree with this answer - see my answer below.
Thanks - I simply hadn't considered that!    I'll read-up on how to install/deploy something like that and see how it fits in with the rest of our solution.
I have used NM_CUSTOMDRAW, but only to change the background colours of individual cells (CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT), and let it fall through to LVN_GETDISPINFO on the main proc.
that's a clever usage of the compact function. I've never seen that in such a use, thanks for the tip.
An excellent tip, but this still relies on the browser sending the ASP.NET_SessionId cookie, which I can't rely on. I need a way to manually pass the SessionId through to the handler.
but within the function the error will have already fired yes?
A pirate walks into a bar, and the bartender says "Excuse me, cap'n, but how did you get a ship's wheel stuck to your crotch?" "I don't know," says the pirate, "but it's drivin' me nuts!"
Good idea, but where to store this singleton dictionary? The Application object will not distribute to other web servers in the farm (or even other process threads in a web garden), sql database is an option, but I was hoping for something more elegant.
Sorry, that joke might not make sense as far as context - when I wrote "Now for the part that drives me nuts" in the original question, I couldn't help but think of that joke...it's a good one. :P
Instead of using seq I would suggest writing for ((i=1; i<=N; i++)); do etc. Besides being part of bash, this also avoids having to first generate all numbers and then executing the for.
I wanted a quick and dirty way to add expression validation to a DSL I wrote. I controll the files being fed to the evaluator, so the can of worms is never opened ;) Also, I only allow one expression, don't add any Namespaces / reference any assemblies. This should stop myself from doing harm too!
this is the "best" solution as long as you can actually XOR the items. Meaning, it depends on the data type. I am not sure if you can do this or not if the items are strings. of course, in that case it can be solved with one more layer of abstraction...
I couldn't find any lint documentation that said it could do this. Do you have a pointer?
Making the window the same size as the screen was my emergency option. I'll try it and will report the result... But I'm curious to know if the behavior of Windows with fullscreen apps is documùented somewhere.

Just an FYI, be careful with queries against this table in a busy production system. This is an aggregate of v$sql and as such can be a very expensive query.
Thanks for the thought! I was thinking about this too. Unfortunately db acccess code is spread over many .asp files so I would have to do a lot of vertical slices and end up coverting most the site.
In case you want do both Unicode and ANSI for C++ strings use something like typedef std::basic_string<TCHAR> tString;
Thanks for the reply. Most people just do fire-and-forget questions. Nice to see you adding some value by reviewing the answers and sharing your conclusions.
Any Source Control system worth it's salt will have full history which you can Diff to past revisions.
Did you read MSDN article? In fact I had situation when 2 3rd party assembly used the same root namespace.
The use of bold face here is very appropriate.
well, then will find them as two groups, just like a regex find.
Don't forget about generators/coroutines, which makes writing iterators (and simulations) a whole lot easier.
`git diff HEAD..branch` is identical to `git diff HEAD branch`. The key thing to remember here is that log takes a list/range of revisions, while diff doesn't. That's why they treat their args differently.
Clarity is in the eye of the beholder - I look at a function and seek a beginning a middle and an end. When the function is small its fine - but when you're trying to work out why something is broken and "Rest of Code" turns out to be non-trivial you can spend ages looking for why ret is
Erm, I disagree about hard to follow, its actually very easy to follow because there is a logic flow. Maintenance? Sir needs a better IDE.
Yep, some time I want to force fellow developers to write it 100 times on a whiteboard unless they stop writing catch(Exception){} :-)
Good argument. This in a way would promote a style of contract, asserting and testing conditions upfront.
Is there any issue with UI development in Mono? Do you have to roll your own?
Joel, you're looking on the wrong object.  System.IO.Directory has the GetFileSystemEntries method. My suggestion was to instead use System.IO.DirectoryInfo, which has the GetFileSystemInfos method.  Hope this helps.
Thanks - that library looks useful, but it still doesn't allow a custom path separator to be specified. It just uses Path.DirectorySeparatorChar.
Mono has support for Winforms and ASP.NET 2.0 and partial support for 3.x features, so you don't need to roll your own.
You're right, but when you create a project you must choose a license for the code and all the choices are open source variants.
That one is great. The link to the site is http://random.irb.hr/signup.php. Sometimes it's a lot easier
Absolutelly, you should really put that code in a #ifdef DEBUG #endif block
This function doesn't seem to produce the shape I'm looking for. If you check the wikipedia article, I chose the red curve that ramps up fast and then trails off over time as seems to model page views, initially high but then people lose interest in the new content over time.
In fact the whole point (from my perspective :-) is that the number of requests depends on the day. I'm not just trying to model random loads across a period of time.
Yeah, you exceeded your 300 characters limit for a comment ;) but thanks!
These are the imports for the function above:         from datetime import datetime,timedelta     from random import weibullvariate     from itertools import imap,count,groupby     how_many_responses = 100     start_date = date(2008, 5, 1)     end_date = date(2008, 6, 1)
IEnumerable sounds like a good way forward actually.  As you suggest, my intention is only to protect the collection from direct modification; the collection members are not going to be modified (or needed to be modified).
I think the caveat is the Contains() Function that I need to check for duplicates, since this has to walk through the whole list everytime. But passing as a ref could work to reduce overhead.
Sorry, I missed it.  Could you add information CheckTokenMembership to your answer to make it complete (so I can mark it as accepted answer)?
VMWare wouldn't need such a trap system.  When they aren't using hardware virtualization support, they check each basic block for privileged instructions and replace them with calls to their handlers.  They /could/ do the same for x64 instructions, but that'd make it an emulator -- not their thing.
Artur,   The article that you mention applies to D3D rather than to hosting WinForms content. If I understand the issues correctly, the airspace problem is fundamental problem relating to the way Win32 works, as is unlikely ever to go away.
The problem for this approach is that a crash resulting from the illegal call might happen in  a wholly different part of the program, which makes debugging it a nightmare.
ofcourse, always loves the c solutions :)
They're not guaranteed to be fitted between the start and end dates because you're using a probability distribution with infinite support. As long as you use the random number returned from the distribution unchanged as a key, you're going to have this problem.
The only caveat I know of with regard to running .Net code on Mono that was compiled on Windows is the use of PInvoke (calling out to the Win32 API's), which unsurprisingly aren't fully supported by Mono on Linux or Mac.  This won't be an issue for your GUI application that calls a webservice  :o)
Why not use mono's built-in Winforms? Not using Winforms will make deployment more complicated.
Mono isn't the only current option - REALsoftware have a product called REALbasic which can compile the same project to native executables for Windows, Mac and Linux:  http://www.realsoftware.com/products/realbasic/
Okay, but what you're doing now is just approximating the distribution. Why not use the distribution itself, or the distribution plus some noise?  As it stands, you're modelling a history-dependent process without using any history.
You actually have to make sure you don't add directories named 'CVS' to cvs, for some reason cvs sometimes catches this, sometimes it doesn't. Run this instead:  find . \! -name "CVS" -and \! -name "Entries" -and \! -name "Repository" -and \! -name "Root" -ty
Running Mono WinForms is a bad user XP because it does not use native widgets but "draws" Windows-like controls.  For real cross-platform GUI with Mono, you can develop a GUI for each platform (WinForms for Windows, Cocoa# for Mac, Gtk#/Qt# for Linux).  As the logic is in WS, this should
I never though of using svn up. However, I am not sure I'm comfortable putting that in a deployment script. Also, svn info doesn't work because it just reports on that directory, not any files in subdirectories. Thanks for the idea though!
It's ironic that your "First Word" is actually 2 words! ;)
Ahh, it looks like I misunderstood the interactions of svn up and svn info. Thanks for making me test my assumptions!
Disregard the comment about svn info, I misunderstood the interaction of svn up and svn info.
I'm not, but I'm sure that info is helpful for those who are. Thanks!
Very few real-world HTML pages will survive an XML parsing library.
I like throwing the Exception: it always works(production and debug), but why then would one write the assert statement too? That only works "half" of the times.
Or perhaps:  bool palindrome(string foo) {     return std::equal(foo.begin(), foo.end(), foo.rbegin()); }
Oh, and string should be passed as a reference: bool palindrome(string const& foo) { return std::equal(foo.begin(), foo.end(), foo.rbegin()); }
Iain,   Why though? In my opinion Silverlight has a much better programming model than HTML/JavaScript. Why shouldn't I use it?  That's what I'm trying to find out.
Nice, i like it.  I always try to stuff things in iterators, but this is definitely easier to read :-)
YXJuLnphcnQ has pretty much the same algotithm, but he does it in C with everything that means. What he has done that is arguably faster is to calculate zeroes and product in the same loop.
You two are iterating an extra time over the array to count zeroes... I wrote basically the same YXJuLnphcnQ did but in python, didn't bother to post it as there were already three solutions
Well that's pretty much my question, how do I generate the distribution + noise, preferably using stdlib functions?  I could write my own PDF function and evaluate + perturb at each point...but that seems harder than writing this approximation.
Also, linear time, i.e. O(n), isn't the same as single pass.
Or maybe none of us is strong enough to work at that company, a very real possibility
No, o(n) isnt the same as a single pass. Err, if I could explain big-O calculus in 300 characters I would be rich. Allow me to get away with - No, it isnt.
It's faster. Probably not much faster, but still.  I would still write it approximately as I did, since I believe it is clearer
I heard Regex was responsible for brining down the Berlin wall.
Thanks. Produces the same results, although I haven't tested for efficiency (yet), but what you say makes perfect sense. In reality, I'm also selecting a primary key.
I agree. I guess my answer was incomplete. I usually don't remove asserts in released code. I'll fix my answer.
Passing as a ref makes no difference here unless you assign a new object to myitems. Simply passing by value will work (the value is the reference to the object, ref is the reference to the variable containing the reference to the object).
Hmm. Testing... That one I need to think about for a bit. You cant test by just shuffling once or twice, it needs to be done a massive ammounts of time (And I'm prepared to claim that the one that says it can be done after one shuffle does not understand randomness)
I really doubt that an extra pass is the difference between not strong enough and strong enough. BTW O() is the asymptotic upper bound to the growth of execution time of an algorithm with respect to the input size (n). So, O(n) means that the execution time grows at most as n grows (plus constants).
If you need this functionality, just make the generic of type <Object> to get the old functionality. Always using generics makes your intentions clearer.
They should indeed stop using Nukes in disaster movies.
Thanks, I will give this a go. I sure wish SOF had email alerts to tell you when a question is updated.
I'm not a C# person, but don't you want a bit of final (or sealed/const/whatever) in there?
I "stole" that part of the question and made a new one at http://beta.stackoverflow.com/questions/56411/how-to-test-randomness-case-in-point-shuffling. It's a tricky one indeed. I hope you dont mind
I think that there are WAY too many things that "text can't do" besides displaying video. ASP all the way is misguiding Sam, because it really depends.
The Java library has ListIterator which is random access and bidirectional.
The case-sensitivity of LIKE depends on the database (and maybe even the collation). I'm using MySQL, where the LIKE comparison is case-insensitive anyway.
Sure, by "simple" I guess I'm also implying (or trying to!) that these are both very small tables, and the application is such low-use that a brute-force LIKE search is perfectly acceptable. I'll edit the question to clarify this - and other points - when activity slows. Cheers.
“random access and bidirectional” is a contradiction. What you mean is that ListIterator is bidirectional and offers read and write access.
Heh. A clarification then. "Assume that you have a algorithm that you believe generates randomness."
Unixutils is definitely nice. I use that more often myself, but I do use Cygwin occasionally.
OK. I wasn't trying to be snarky. I don't really know if you're asking "how to test randomness" which can be asked without referring to card shuffling, or if you're asking "how to test if my shuffling alogrithm has screwed up my good RNG."
because WinForms support is maintained only by Mono devs and as you can see on their website, it's still their second priority. The first one is GTK#. GTK+, wxWindows and QT have far bigger and more dedicated teams than WinForms on Mono so I wouldn't bet on very long lasting WinForms support in Mono
It would be nice to wrap, but for certain reasons and in certain circumstances it needs to be avoided. I will edit with more code.
Mono actually is the only serious option. REALBasic has nothing to do with .NET framework and this question was about cross platform .NET development.
Does methodB return normally?
Could you be more specific / offer examples, please?  I'm not an ASP coder, so I'm not sure what you mean.  I'm trying to research alternatives to present to my team.  Thanks in advance.
Jonas,   Thanks for the Link on back-forward navigation: that should be very helpful.
Did you mean to link to something...?
I think that is what he wanted... a way to access and control a currently running instance of WMP.
Thanks for the code snippet, but I wish to avoid any type of wrapping when necessary, as this problem arises from a VB6 migration issue, where large amounts of code expect lower bounds > 0. Therefore I am doing my best to determine first if it is possible to NOT use a custom class.

Yes, I realized that after seeing your answer.  Thanks!
Boxing/unboxing _only_ applies to value types.
Looks like your submission doubled up, might want to get shot of this one!
hmm, not sure whether or not to up-vote this as it doesnt answer the question but it's useful and succinct nonetheless! ;-)
This question should be edited to clarify the name of the primitive type is "bool?" and not "bool". There are good answers below, but the question is unclear.
It's not clear what you are trying to match. Given "\n" do you want to match: (1) the newline character, (2) the sequence "backslash, then n" , (3) the sequence "backslash, then a newline character"?
There are ways of XORing strings by XORing the individual chars - you would just have to have a temporary variable as large as the largest string. What wouldn't work is trying to XOR a linked list or some other complicated data structure, but this problem is simply about integers.
he's looking for a regex that will match a single character (non-space?) preceded by an ODD number of '\' characters.
I agree that one test is not sufficient. Additional test are required.     One test is better than nothing.

Agreed! we don't update through Internet. Our "launcher" only fires a process, the update code is in the app. In either case, the user never does this automatically, we do it through VNC because it is a Medical DB and we don't want to risk the DB in case there are DB scripts to run. Good
LOL, well we don't autoupdate. The user never autoupdates. We do :) Our user's DBs contain very important medical data, what we do is we update the server (using an in-house wizard) that backups the DB and executes scripts and then if everything is "ok", it "publishes" the updat

We're working around these sorts of limitations in part, but I'm encountering resistance (separate issue!) to ditching ASP controls entirely.  I'm using jQuery for most JavaScript coding at the moment and, apart from ASP changing some IDs, it's working well. Thanks.
For the cases when a chargeback happens (ie CC owner claims that the transaction was wrong) you'll want to keep the last four digits of the CC number.
Maybe also the first 6 digits for statistical reasons. The first 6 identify the issuing bank, so you can see if there are lots of fraudulent transactions frome one bank, so you can start blocking several creditcards in bad cases.
Not quite what I wanted. It means that I'm having to monkey with the user's data in the background (not WYSIWYG) or be throwing errors that I would have put a lot of explanation behind. Thanks though.

There is no need for `Math.sqrt()` in `isInQuadrant()`.
Well, according to Joel you should up-vote if you find it useful - not neccessarily if it's the answer. But then I would say that ;)

FWIW, .Net Style Guildlines specifically recommend against using prefixes like 'o' and 's'.  That's a change since the VB6 days.
Not really -- It's pretty straight forward if you're coming from the perspective of using the HTML and having the ASP.NET MVC framework fill in the holes. I would recommend looking at Stephen Walther's site : http://weblogs.asp.net/StephenWalther/ for a good deal of tutorials and http://asp.net/mvc

Even though I'm going with XDebug i will check out Pear Benchmark. I can use it in other projects
I'm guessing that they do exactly the same thing. In my experience, generally, you can either change the registry directly, or use group policy and get the same results. I suspect that simply changing the registry does not update some meta data for the group policy editor somewhere.
I think the example is simply to demonstrate that inheriting from board does not make sense with in the context of ThreeDBoard and all of the method signatures are meaningless with a Z axis.
I assume you mean the exact same result set.  That means the same columns (and same data types) with the same row data.  Correct?
I have used FileHelpers and it is a great lib that is very easy to use.
You might want to add some of the tag information into the title.  That way when people scan the question list it stands out more.  Good luck!
Although not as easy as having the archive bit flipped on the folder itself, if Windows ends up not supporting auto "rolling up" of the archive flag to the folder level, reading until you find at least one file (or no files) with archive flags may be your only option, given your above con
The js code takes the current computer time local to where the cookie is stored, then saves the cookie with an expiration shortly before then (ie, in the past as far as the local computer is concerned). Since the browser uses the local computer time to expire cookies, time sync shouldn't be it...

Pure CSS would be nice.  I already have nbsps in there, but it feels dirty. :)
The syntax should probably be:  private static interface SomeClass_Integer extends SomeClass<Integer> {}  I have the same problem and this is the work around I use so the approach will work. But I hope somebody has the answer we are looking for
nope, I don't want to remove all duplicates, just sequential duplicates.
SQL server would be your best bet.  If you are using state server for this already, it would be a similar penalty.  Or you could write your own WCF service that would handle this exchange.  It could work as the unique ID broker as well as identity storage.  Or even use a SQL endpoint service.
It does work in IE8 though, so just give it about a decade, and you're good to go.
Thanks for the replies, I'm getting close! But I'm trying to select all stocks whose property someValue points to any bonus from the Bonus table...
Kristopher's answer is technically correct but fwiw, the ~ folder on a Mac is /Users not /Home
How so?  Whether copying or moving a folder controlled by SVN, you run into the problem I described.  I provided a probably reason and a workaround.  The question asked about "whether it is OK to copy a directory that is under version control and start working on both copies"
Awesome! Spoofing here is not a big concern - the problem is that average users are swapping cards and not telling anybody. The company wants an automatic way to poll who has what card. I doubt anyone would know how to hack it.
I like this. Clarity increases.
(By the way, the "Query Modem" step you described did work. Going through "phone and modem options" made me give a default area code first, and since I will configure multiple cards on this machine I'm not sure if that's good. The query can also be found via Device Manager, righ
IList<T> does not implement IList.  And I need to implement IList for serialization purposes.
Bravo! How did I miss this? Do note that STR() takes a float, not a decimal. SQLServer Help is very explicit about it ("... an expression of approximate numeric (float) data type"): if your decimals have enough digits, rounding will cause you trouble. This is still a great answer for most
Yeah, I thought the same thing when I was writing the answer.
9:5 is not a valid time representation. Must be 9:05 or something like that.
Yeesh.  Personally, I believe this is ass backwards.  Interfaces should hold the bare minimum functionality for a type, and base classes should provide a rich framework upon which customization can be built.  Put that in an interface and you just made it very hard to implement.
True. You could put the extern "C" part inside an #ifdef __CPLUSPLUS block to get around that.
To answer your question, I would expect it to result in a, b, c, a, b, c
You can't have 2 indexers 'this', but you can have a 'string IDataErrorInfo.this' and a 'T IList<T>.this'. You'll have to cast the object before accessing the indexer, but it works.
May I ask how you're serializing a custom indexer? When I've tried to index a custom indexer (for WCF), I get an ASP yellow-screen-of-death message saying that custom indexers cannot be serialized. I eventually just gave up on the idea.
Very nice link, thanks. Fun thing is that I'm subscribed to Jeff's blog, I just didn't remember that post. Thanks again!
You can also do Start->Run and type services.msc to get to the services and stop it.
Without knowing what you're trying to do, it's not possible to answer this question.  I suggest updating the question with info about the size of your project, how many tables you think you'll have, how many records, etc.
I think the web applications vs. sites thing may actually be to do with the updatable bit as Will mentions - my apps are not marked updatable. I think you're probably right about the organisation thing, I'd need to have a bit more of a play to confirm.
Not really answering you question, just a comment:  "as far as I know, there are no mac ergonomic models"  Kinesis makes Mac compatible ergonomic keyboards http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/
I upvoted this since your misunderstanding was probably due to my unclear original question.
I'm accepting the answer but I'm still not sure if it is a really must having the file in a directory outside the document root. It will add some performance problems I think.
Nobody said your interfaces need to be huge. Smaller, multiple interfaces and richer base classes make a great API.
Yeah maybe not on the operator idea, but I still am curious as to what benefits there might be to returning void over this
You're probably right!  We have a requirement to also run under Java 1.5 so this isn't an option for us.
I can see how that would be a problem, though it is not a limitation in say C# or VB code.
edit needed: s/bulled/bulleted/
...I meant you were right about it being the easiest way, not right about being lazy.  :-P
i see your smiley, but don't you think a less aggressive approach would achieve more than outright contrariness?
Nothing that you're saying is wrong, per se, but I wouldn't want to do any of these things.  The complexity involved in somehow dynamically going between object -> array -> ArrayList is so great, and the cost of just creating a simple ArrayList so small, that I think this is just a bad sugges
Changing "duplicates" to "sequences" clarified things quite a bit.  What a difference a word makes.  Strunk & White were right.  :)
Thats true but it would also allow you to write streamlined code such as myCollection.remove(item1).add(item2).swap(item3, item4)
Yes thats why I mentioned this being fluent-interface style, as you say, there is more to a fluent interface than just method chaining.  The question is whether there is really any disadvantage to this
I actually use tables probably more than I should, but I think that the argument against using tables here would mean that too much of your style (the layout) is in the HTML document and to change the layout in the future would require changing much of the "guts" of the page.
True. If you want it even better, you could do     /(?<!\\)(?>\\\\)*\\q/ It has a slightly better performance in case of a non-match.
I'm looking to cache full pages. Of course the system would have to have some sort of 'update' feature whereby if the database content changed then the cached version would reflect those changes.
if you watch for correctly working caching, the performance problems will be negligible. I've answered how to do this in another question here: http://beta.stackoverflow.com/questions/48555/best-way-to-compress-html-css-js-with-moddeflate-and-modgzip-disabled#48761
A debugger is much more than something that shows debug messages. It lets you break the running application and step through the code line by line watching the values of variables change as each statement executes.
One problem with WMI - it was only introduced in Windows 2000. If you know your code won't be running on 9x or NT 3/4 then the WMI approach is fine.
Why the emphasis on 'in the wild'. Is there some top secret way to enable it?
Technically the checksum is optional. From RFC 768: "An all zero transmitted checksum value means that the transmitter generated no checksum (for debugging or for higher level protocols that don't care)."
So, how many duplicate posts did you create when you posted this? :)
I don't think it is that simple. You have slightly changed the question (requirements) so that interface makes more sense. You should always ask yourself whether you are defining a contract (interface) or a shared implementation (base class).
Could you put "dynamic content" in the title so people will know what the question is about when they ask a similar question and so that it will match more relevant questions in the related questions suggestions.
WebMethods? I FEEL YOUR PAIN!!!
Actually, I found a bug with the "Ask Question" button.  It's up on uservoice now if you want to vote for it.
I would get a syntax error: Error: syntax error Source File: http://localhost/js/bad/filename/file.js Line: 1 Source Code: <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"   Instead of a 404, alerting me of the problem. This also appears in the firefox console
this would work, except the site i'm working on display's a "Page not found" instead of a 404. So I would get 200's for things that didn't exist!
Current JVMs optimize heavily for object allocation and garbage collection concerns wrt to this are almost always unfounded.
Code will always get you props on my questions ;o)
The reason this matters is that processes started by the debugger use a special "debug heap". See http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2008/09/03/anatomy-of-a-heisenbug.aspx or http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/974tc9t1.aspx .
Okay, it seems the hardest thing here is figuring out how things should work. I've not seen this before, so I'll ask. If you had lines of the form baabbaab, would you want to reduce first to baab and then further to bab, or just stop at baab, since it was matched against a removed block already?
Actually, you have the style guide's preference exactly backwards.  Implicit continuation is preferred, explicit backslash is to be used only if necessary.
@Joel: I really don't understand where you got any of your assumptions from here. I don't read any of that in his question.
I've seen this before, but now it's taking all possible the windows and displaying them under each other.
Thanks to both of you, I'll check tomorrow. It is indeed a heisenbug, and a random one at that, as I can get a few debug cycles under way before it exhibits itself again.
The http://ajaxload.info seems to be the standard generator for these but it is limited to the smaller images. I would be interested in seeing a generator for larger images (for use in overlays possibly)
I clarified my question, because your answer indicates I haven't been clear enough in the first place. I know of the behaviour you described, but that is not my problem.
This will not work because Regex.Split is designed to capture based on separators, not tokens. Use Regex.Match to get the desired effect.

Am I to understand that people have more than one Eclipse workspace? Maybe that's where I didn't get the relationship. I have one workspace for everything...
The question I linked says not all browsers respect the HTTP Cache directives as they should which is why you need to set several properties to ensure pages are never cached.  If you want to use a date why not pick a fixed date in the past rather than 1 second ago.
The accounts are loaded into a list box on server side.  So not sure this is happening.  Thanks though
Yes, but the things in my Eclipse workspace are unrelated projects...I mean, they are called projects...Maybe I'm abusing Eclipse.
One of the handy features of this too is that if you can set project dependencies within a solution, so that a given project will make sure all of its dependencies are up to date before doing its own compilation.
Generally, in a project, would you have 1 EXE and many DLLs or is it likely that multiple projects would compile into EXEs that interact with each other?
Sounds like it, but I have never used Eclipse. If I am building a company's outfacing website and our main product (say a winforms app or something) I am not going to put them into the same solution, since they are unrelated. I would have to open everything and manage it all together that way.
There are cases when you have multiple EXEs, but I would say it is much more common to have 1 EXE with multiple DLLs.
You forgot to mention that solutions specify what projects get built for what configuration. You can build different projects in a Release build than in a Test or a Debug build
Dunno, but you can make one.  Obviously it rarely has zero projects for very long...
Yeah, I know. But, using too many of system tools and building wrappers around them makes it harder to, lets say, migrate application to other system... But I guess I'll stick to what I got now, if it works ;)
I don't believe so.  Or, at least, not for the situation where you'd be wanting to inherit from this class to add new "enum" values.  Final and sealed prevent inheritance IIRC.
The interface is a contract. You're only exposing the part of the contract that a service requires. If you have a 'PettingZoo', you certainly don't want to expose 'Mate'-ing to the user!
If the overload doesn't exist, I would have to say no.
The first option is the same as that of Kilhoffer  The second won't work, adding new() to the where requires the type to have a public parameter, which is exactly what I don't want
With a good abstraction barrier you can implement it whenever it's convenient! "Now is better than never, Although never is often better than *right now*." :)
Whenever a change needs to be made to an interface, the non-breaking way to do so is to create a new interface that inherits from the old one.  This preserves existing implementations and lets you do whatever you wish in the new one.
Small chance of failure and a limit on packet size.
Your example doesnt support the concept. You can do the same thing with an interface. You don't just have to have a base class for that.
Thanks for the insight! VFP's binary-treated tables, forms, etc. are a challenge to work with in SVN.
Yeah, I've found it to be a pain too. Thanks for the tip on inheritInChildApplications.
Yeah, his post appeared as I was typing mine.
When I've tried that on my system, it's just literally giving me info on the one and only IP address NMBLookup has returned. Doesn't list anything beyond the shares for that IP address and the server info.
More interesting, if, rather than doing nmblookup -M -- -, I do nmblookup workgroup, I get a better listing. Obviously this will only be machines in the WORKGROUP group (which all of ours are), but the behaviour of the tool is very different. Any ideas?
That is perfect thanks! I finally found an example online, but I'm glad it's here for future reference.
They are great because they always compile.
Won't a malformed document fail to parse entirely? What I saw inside CreateNavigator seemed to deal only with valid markup
Yeap, the latest alpha, which I believe is 3, added Resharper 4 support.
This might be the right path but I don't think it gets me all of the way there. I still need to be able to open files that are in the context directory.
Another good question!  In my case I would want ababab to reduce to abab but no further.
Reference can be null. In some cases, you pass refrence params in as this:     function(*ptr); If ptr is NULL, so will be the reference.
I do like the syntax of creating the Disjunction and naming it or. It's a lot more readable than the other solution.
I'm almost tempted to remove the "subjective" tag because I think that this question might have an actual answer.
You're right, Andrei. We actually use IntelliJ IDEA for a lot of stuff at work, and I'm looking at Eclipse right now. I know I'm somewhat old fashioned, but I really prefer the command line for a lot of Unix work because it's just so useable. In the Windows world it's another matter...
This is bound to spark a flame war between the two camps.  This is a personal decision, and there are plenty of arguments for and against that can be found elsewhere.
I would agree that the TimeLapse view does the job in showing exactly who change what line. Use it all the time.
I disagree with that. Parsing doesn't have anything to do with it. If it did, SQL run via EXECUTE would not be transaction-safe.
This is true, the OP does seem to want a blocking call, although I shudder at the thought a bit... This is probably a better solution.
The answers so far are pretty one-sided and I've seen at least two arguments that I had never thought of or seen elsewhere.
I am sure you have seen this. Got it from a quick google http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/csharpgeneral/thread/5f954d01-dbaf-410a-9b0d-6bb6f57d0b85/
So is this to say that simply wrapping the above code in a transaction, SQL Server does in fact implement select locking as described in the above links?
Isnt that what I'm doing? SQL Server is acknowledging the messages on behalf of the caller and returning them.
This doesn't seem to work for me.  I'm adding listviewitems at run-time and the columns stay skinny.
A singleton is tied to ClassLoader lifetime of the class loader that loaded it, as much as a static is.
see below, I answered with the problem
Good question, this is something I was thinking about very recently, but you beat me to asking it.
Weird. Perhaps the ListView needs to be visible and with the items added already. Or perhaps a call to Application.DoEvents might do the trick?  You could always try sending LVSCW_AUTOSIZE yourself using P/Invoke: http://vbnet.mvps.org/index.html?code/comctl/lvcolumnautosize.htm (link for VB6)
How do you launch time lapse view in p4win?
Well, it could theoretically be a problem in any language that supports introspection.
They say they would have to add a rule for each individual user.  I think there has to be a way to use some sort of substitution rule for the user name.
I'm also curious about clarification of the question.  So far we just seem to have 3 examples with an ambiguous general rule of removing sequences (of repeated substrings).  Could you maybe give an application of this code, or try to explain more fully how to decide the border cases like cbaacba(a)?
No I meant something like this (untested):  BEGIN TRANSACTION SELECT * FROM UnacknowledgedDemands; UPDATE ActionMessages SET AcknowledgetTime = getdate() WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM UnacknowledgedDemands WHERE ActionMessages.ActionMessageId = UnacknowledgedDemands.ActionMessageId) COMMIT TRANSACTION
So thats is basically solutions 2 then, thanks for point out the other question though.
But there's no EXECUTE here.  Good point though - how does SQL know what to lock when running arbitrary SQL via execute?
I worked in a similar position and shared the exact same feelings.  It seems that most people just don't want to be professional testers forever.
> I would find someone who wants a QA position, but has strong developement/coding/problem solving skills.  Good luck with that. In my experience anyone with strong development skills won't be applying for QA jobs!
It sounds like you want to know about Cygwin itself, but the skills needed to be a "power user" of Cygwin are not all that different from Unix itself.  Maybe you could clarify that?
I have also seen this, but I'm worried that setting it to off just reverses the problem (the fast queries will now run slow).  The only reason I know of for this to affect things is related to parameter sniffing, where a different plan is chosen.
This solution doesn't work with the example:  print BeautifulSoup('<html>&#x01ce;</html>', convertEntities=BeautifulSoup.HTML_ENTITIES)  This returns the same HTML entity
...but dereferencing NULL is undefined.  For example, you can't test if a reference is NULL (e.g., &ref == NULL).
Shouldn't that be inject{|s,e| (s.to_i .. e.to_i) } ?   As written, it returns an Array with a range as a single element instead of a Range.
The lines to be reduced must be together (aba -> aba, aab -> ab, ababa -> aba), and I'm only looking for a sequence of two lines at most (aaaa -> aa).  cbaacbaa would reduce to cbacba.  It's a log file with occasional duplication of one or two lines.
I haven't encountered that issue. And setting it off actually sets it equal to what SMS runs it in, which is how I found the problem to begin with.
@blair, I would want baabbaab to reduce to babab
I was also able to install a file to the Program folder on the Vista, NonAdmin computer and it shows up in the STart>Programs>MyProgramGroup
Geeze! This is an amazing place. I've diddled with this for a couple of days. In less than five minutes, boom, I'm smiling again. Thank you very much, John.
It's false that Ruby 1.8 has only green threads, several implementations of Ruby 1.8 have native threads: JRuby, XRuby, Ruby.NET and IronRuby.  Fibers don't allow the creation of native threads, they are *more lightweight* than threads. They are actually semi-coroutines, i.e. they are cooperative.
Thanks Sam - sometimes I fail see the simple options; which in this case was having the textbox bound to a string property in my ViewModel.
Thanks Nidonocu. Your answer is also perfect, but I marked Sam's response as the answer because he answered slightly before yours. Thanks again though!
Alternatively, passing pointers (not references) is fine if you give explicit guarantees on the lifetime and ownership of those objects.   If you pass references, there is no way for WidgetHolder to "own" the objects.
I think it's saying that if you have brackets around an expression already, use those, but don't put brackets around an expression just for the purpose of breaking it over multiple lines.  No hard-and-fast rule though.  I do think for the line in the question though, a backslash is the way to go.
Nelson: did you try _COMMAND = SYS(2450, 1) in CONFIG.FPW ?

Thanks for the follow-up. I don't tend to use "attach to process" so I forget that it's another option. cheers.
instead of keeping it running, just use the whole Cache removal trick to "schedule" it.

IN VC++ *ptr will crash, pretty sure in gc++ it will segfault too
Oh, it's building ADO commands.  I'll try using the trace and report back!
what exactly do you mean by "avoids the lookups"? does it result in better performance?
This is what we had started to do but I thought I might as well ask SO to see if something exists already.  Thanks for the link, though!
This looks like exactly what I need, with potentially 2 drawbacks: 1) It is unclear whether clicking on the resultant executable actually launches a webserver, or if not, what it does 2) It doesn't look like you can package the app for cross-platform.  Is that the case?
Looks like <machinekey /> only affects the ViewState
Sorry Knox but the issue is that its not necessarily the top four scores that will count. There must be at least one Lady/Junior score included :)
Thanks...I actually hadn't heard of Spring.Net, do you like it?
yea, i know that.. and that's annoying XD besides that there are a couple more restrictions as well
Hey! Would you please spell my name correctly? Thanks, Esteban
The syntax is mailto:address@example.com?subject=Hello&body=World!  Parameters must be url-escaped
You should add more details about your edit on September 4. Specifying List<UglyProblem> instead of only List in the @OneToMany(mappedBy="person") mapping changes the nature of the problem, since I think we previously assumed you wanted to map a Person to a list of Problems (not Ugl
I'd like the application to "know" whether or not a correct password was entered.  For example, it shouldn't let you change the password unless you enter the original password (otherwise, pranksters w/ access to your file could re-encrypt it with a key you don't know).
@David Touche, although I did it to better illustrate what an interface is for and what an abstract class is for vis-a-vis his understanding. A dog and a cat does not appear to be a rigid requirement!
Got it -- I missed that.  Hopefully the comparison will be use useful to other stumbling on this question.  I'll edit the text a bit.
That's a good idea in terms of productivity, but this is partly a hobby/learning project so digging into the crypto libraries is half the fun.
Could you clarify what is meant by "as you would hide this method and not be able to call inherited"?
To answer your question in the comment: Yes, you should CloseHandle when you don't need the handle anymore.
In my opinion it's a matter of probability. It's least probable that there will be several ACMEs, but FooBars are all around the place. I find Microsoft scheme to be very reasonable. I'm using *techonolgies* from *vendors* not an abstract Suber.Duper.Utility classes.
The problem with endings like "Manager" and "Helper" is they are much too general... I read a great article at some point that said you should strive harder to figure out exactly what it does and name it accordingly, otherwise the suffix conveys very little and the class grows t
*to be a monster (sorry, my comment got cut off despite being under 300 characters... BUG!)
Thanks for the key derivation function reference.  I noticed in my proof-of-concept tests that the hashed value was never the same length as the key expected by the encryption function so I would just pad the hash - I knew there had to be a better way and this appears to be it.
Okay, used the trace, I didn't see anything unusual though. =(  I posted the SQL statements that were picked up by the Profiler above.
Aye, I was reading in the documentation that in order to do transactions I couldn't use a Client-Side Cursor.  And I also made sure that they were all using the same active connection as well.  Thank you for helping out with this, it's been a weird problem for sure =(
Great the distribution looks much better the one generated via simulation.
Good info too about the stored procedures there... I had a feeling it was doing something like that, but I wasn't sure... I'd never actually done a Trace before today, so I've never seen those kinds of procedures being called under the hood. =) =)
"But solving bad programmers by throwing in new technology sounds like a bad idea" - Nice point, thanks.  It worries me when I see developers who are so specialised in ASP.NET to the expense of almost everything else.
out of curiosity... is there any reason to initialize result to "oops"? that value can never be returned from this method, can it?
I have to say that I really disagree, at least for enterprise applications.  The data is the application.
Kristopher it looks like you resurrected this question by linking to it from another question.  I'm wondering what you mean by "rich interactions", and how it would be impractical to implement them without objects?
This answer is inaccurate.  You are not limited to interfaces with jMock.  You can mock concrete classes with the ClassImposteriser.
I agree that having lots of dynamic SQL sprinkled throughout code-behind is evil.  You have to keep the Db calls clear and distinct.  Wrapping sproc calls in static helper methods achieves a sort-of separation without going all the way down the ORM route.
But note that using backticks or $( ) will still fork another shell... using the environment variable is the least-cost method.
Lots of people are bringing up de-coupling, and allowing one layer to change without affecting the other.  Stored procedures do this better than any ORM!  I can radically alter the data model, and as long as the procedures return the same data, nothing breaks.
Awesome! I'm actually familiar with SDL. I'm going to look into this.
Stored procedures are probably the best example of orthogonality and separation of concerns.  If used correctly, they completely encapsulate the database.
True, but the question title and tags are generalized, so the answer might as well be generalized too. An environment variable is the "better" option in this case, but it isn't a general answer to the question.
I'll second the "if it works in Firefox, it usually works in Safari" statement—especially for Firefox 3.
I think it's the ToolTip property.
Control class doesn't have ToolTip property. It has ToolTipText
I have grown spoiled in Seattle having internat access everywhere.
Oops sorry I'm looking at a different MenuItem class.
There's a big danger in doing things this way.  Most complex queries end up needing to be re-written entirely by a DBA to get them to scale.  No amount of index tuning can do what changing a query can sometimes do.  This type of Linq2Sql is extremely tight coupling.
I agree with consistency throughout the app.  To be honest, I changed directions on my current project a while back and never got around to fixing 100% of the original model, which makes things confusing.  Good decisions are best made early.
David, just noticed your question "Understanding Pointers".  Great question, great answers!  All points mentioned in that post also apply to my "unsafe" answer below.
Eric, true indeed. I once was an OOP zealot (the way others in this thread seem to be) but I met a guy who owns a company who is highly successful selling DB-driven apps. That rocked my world. I'm still an OOP/TDD buff but I don't frown upon DB-centric anymore.
what kind of complexities? This solution doesn't require any variance.
I think a good compromise would be mapping an ORM to stored procedures, except that this can easily be done poorly: if you just create the 4 CRUD procs for each table, you have accomplished nothing.  Can you map big, coarse-grained procs to entities, or does that not really get you anywhere?
yes i'm sure, it was pre-partial classes anyhow i.e version 1.0
In addition to CRUD operations, the Microsoft ORMs let you add methods onto the entity classes that map directly to any stored proc you want to throw at it (provided that all input/output types are mappable).
Unfortunately no. It was easy to try, and the value returned by LVIR_BOUNDS and LVIR_LABEL are identical: they both return the entire subitem, wall-to-wall.
rptony, Isn't compiler design, operating system design a little over the top? Even algorithm analysis can get a little too theoretical.  I agree with the rest of the list...
Only change the product code for Major upgrades, small frequent updates should retain the same product code and just increase the version.  Changing the product code is effectively a new application in the eyes of windows installer.
I like that, much more elegant.
Thanks! Good answer! What would be the difference, what would be better solving this using SubVersion for example?
To clarify, FTS would not help without changing the existing query.
Brilliant! Exactly what I was after.  I suspect this is what wrumsby was shooting for in his answer.Thanks guys. The quality of content on this site continues to impress me.
Never had that before, but could you check if the list in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\9.0\ProjectMRUList is empty?
Manual testing doesn't fully replace automatic (or vice a versa). The purpose of automated testing is not to find errors, it's to make sure that new changes don't break already tested old features.
or even:  for (...) {    if (cond1 || cond2) continue;     ... }  I use it like this all the time, get your breakout on one line
Damn, that above comment would've worked better with a line breaks working, the point being keep   if (cond1 || cond2) continue;   on one line
Localgroups are local to the server; they are not stored in the AD. Though they may include AD users and/or groups as members.
Great comments, pointing out the security aspect.
I really dislike Delphi, but I love the fact this algorithm (unlike most of the others on this page) takes into account that factorial results don't change (and for large n are expensive) and you might as well only calculate a particular value once.
This looks good. It's always been mapping that CSDL onto the SSDL that I've wondered about. Where does the SSDL begin? I guess I'm wondering if this is simply more than us describing the entities with CSDL on a blank designer surface. It's always been the mapping that's been a question to me.
Was this recent or during the beta? I had a pretty sour beta experience that didn't really get me excited about the EF.
Re-creating procs every time (conditionally dropping) is a much better solution.  If use exec, you gain nothing and there are downsides; your proc has to escape strings and any line numbers in errors will refer to the line number relative to the exec command.
Yeah, but will that end the job?
I've missed something or the result is : "Alpha Beta, Gamma,"
Yes, Vista does have some *interesting* <g> Virtualizing. But I tried this and it didn't work.
Forget it : i've read it too quickly. But I still don't like the in-loop setting of the separator.
Can we chime in with the "language agnostic" label ?
I believe the StringBuilder (or a similar construct) was implied in the other responses. So, where's your second function? You promised two.
I would use += instead of = to show that there is a concat taking place.
I saw that before the comment and added (concatenate) to be really clear (they might not know 'c').
Not quite sure why this was voted down.  This is IMHO the only way to get the external IP address of any system.  Just because a router tells you what it thinks your IP address is, or what it thinks it's IP address is doesn't mean there isn't another NAT in place.
Don't you want to change `=` for `(assign?)` to be more language-agnostic? The poor Pascal people don't know what you mean. ;-) Seriously, though.
That works on FF3, but the bottom border isn't drawn on the left div for some strange reason.
The irony is, I'm doing this because a designer said so!
Or just have a server of the same OS that you can test on...
Oooh look, you just asked a question of "religious nature"
Google analytics and finance use SWF-based charts (not sure if they're Flash or Flex though).  It seems like SWF charts do a better job with larger volumes of data than JS ones.
I'm using a dataprovider with to_xml now.  But, I'm wondering when it is more appropriate to just parametrize all the data into an embed tag versus making another http call.
This works in theory, but I still use my original code in production just to avoid having to use an eval.
Nicolas: I doubt you will be able to get something "nicer" in the imperative setting as you will typically have to separately handle the first or last item in the list. I can only imagine doing it nicer if you have some loop operator with an "in between" part: while C do S and in between T od.
This has been happening since Tiger for me.
Down/up works. So theoretically you could search, then hit down, then up, then ctrl-e. But I'm looking for some elite termcap or readline patch to solve this.
Not really. No matter how you cut it, every language deals with strings in a set number of ways. All of the other solutions assume that you have an append string method, which is certainly not language agnostic, as c doesn't have it. You can't really deal with strings without making some assumptions
Good answer, but I was looking for more of a iterative or fancy Ruby way to do this.
Re other function: I considered it, then didn't. Really. I could demonstrate the c way of doing it, I suppose. Then we'd at least have all the major language families covered, but I'll leave that for someone else to do.
Qt has networking modules so the HTTP request can be handled easily in Qt without needing to use an extra library.
If I could understand it, this might be a really interesting question. We need some more context here. When would you need but not know the name of the variable? Can we go a "why" or two back - what problem are you trying to solve?
Thanks, but that doesn't particularly help. The specific problem I'm having is that I have three variables I want to iterate through and if they aren't all a certain data type, I want to print out that they aren't and print the name of that variable.  Thanks though!
One thing to watch out for if you do this is that some software, such as A-V scanners, requires a Server licence rather than a Workstation license to run on Windows Server and these can be an order of magnitude more expensive.
Addendum: Why does great content and friendly urls help? People will link to it which will lead to higher page rank.
It's wasteful to set _seperator_ each time through the loop.  Maybe a good optimizer would factor it out, though.
Of course, if we're dropping language independence then you could just use string.Join(separator, xs) :)
If you're really worried about allocation speed, you can initialise the StringBuilder to the needed capacity (strings.Sum(s => s.Length) + (strings.length - 1) * separator.length) and do away with reallocating space at all.
C most certainly does have an append string function: strcat.
Why is that an incorrect requirement? High page rank = $ for a lot of websites.
Because page rank is not a software developer requirement, it should be an SEO expert requirement or something similar. The requirement is more akin to a system's analyst job than a software dev's
<Insert snide comment about picking a terser language here.> ;-)
SEO can affect the way a site is designed especially the URL strategy and accessbility requirement to a minor extent for the bot. If it's not included as a requirement if often comes up right at the end of the project.
That's technically correct. You can run WSS/MOSS on Windows Vista but it's unsupported. Otherwise your options are Windows 2003 SP1/2008. A good alternative is to dev in virtual machines.
Jon: not in the way used in the previous examples. strcat doesn't return a new string and has far different semantics than strA + strB.
I would imagine so. Depends on the client machines, but surely on Vista you could have some sort of rule that matched something like C:\Users\*\LocalSettings\etc\etc.
David: then you've iterated over the collection twice. I'm not certain that in a managed environment where reallocs are relatively cheap that counting ahead would put you ahead. Then again, there's only one way to find out. :)
Edward, you've got a point there. I still think it should be part of the system analysts' job, though. Admitting that, I guess that means I concede that it is software development related. :D
Powers of two: don't forget 1 = 2^0!
Compute the GCD in pairs, first computing n = gcd(a[0], a[1]). Then n = gcd(n, a[2]), ... iteratively through the rest of your list.
@Ray: yes, using "key, value" in the for loop avoids having to do the hash table lookup of d[key] for every item in the dictionary. I believe the above solution will be faster, but you'd have to measure it on your system and data set to be sure.
I am probably just tangled too deep in the developer community ;-)
Yes! Let's start returning them ugly confusing stack traces to them!
Great answer.  In case it isn't immediately obvious, (as Jonas Follesø points out in his answer) - the key to this is using Enum values to the power of 2 (1,2,4,8,16,etc)
See my comment about the ternary operator below, and simply checking that the string you're building is non-empty
I edited question to explain why it's not centralized - otherwise what you described is exactly what we do now. We are not happy with how source control tools handle binary files and deployment scenarious though.
The process is awfull, agreed, but there are important legacy and practical reasons for it. Total centralization is not possible - basically, you don't want to build your core together with some flimsy interface plugin.
Anything that can be done with objects can also be done without objects.  I find that OO design is usually much easier than non-OO methods for doing anything "complicated", but I understand that it doesn't work for everyone.
Thanks, it's a possible solution. But I better like even what we have now. I'm actually impressed by performance of our version control (SourceGear) with huge binary project.
Nick, that was indeed the problem. I figured it would be useful to post the question so I could also put the answer there. I hadn't counted on someone answering so quickly!
MapDialogRect doesn't help if your window is not a dialog unfortunately, but calculating by hand works very well.
Actually I'm looking at SharpDevelop, for some reason I ofter call it iTextSharp :-) Thanks for comment, anyway.

You're right, most people won't change their opinions. I realize the focus of Stack Overflow is supposed to be objective questions, but subjective ones are so much more fun! Personally, I have learned a lot from this discussion.
FTS would not help without changing the existing query. But, if your dataset is small enough, you can use LIKE without a problem for some time.
Everything from ASP.NET or PHP's point of view is just a string in response buffer.
Chris: can you rephrase your actual question above to reflect this use case?  I'm still not quite sure what your goal is.
You don't encode the input before you process it. You encode the input when you output it to the user... this is how XSS attacks work.
How to declare a table that accomplishes this task? Can you provide an example?
I need the center DIV to change size.
Color are important and the parent DIV has to stay at a fixed width and height. I have updated the details in the question.
Just debugging information.like "X is Foo"
I think I left out an important word up there :) in the first bullet.
It's also included in Vista default installation now.
Nowt, 'cept the recursive call. Why do we need to do that in C#?
That isn't really different from how I did it anyway - you still need to load VB's backward-compatibility stuff in order to be able to do it.
Close, but not available on XP y deafult.  Though I will consider it.
I realize it is a primitive metric. I just wanted to know a ball park figure without drawing any major conclusions from it.
We have our own client side software and at this stage we're not operating over the internet.
I've used that too. It has a pie chart showing what proportion of each type of line is used in the code.
jquery for a treecontrol sounds like a good idea, thanks for the suggestion. Could you elaborate on how to use a recursive lambda for rendering.
I was originally using ArcGIS 9.2, but that doesn't work well with C# and 64 bit, so I am now using GDAL (http://www.gdal.org). Good answer though.
This is head recursion.  It can fall prey to a stack overflow if the directories are nested deep enough.
I've added some clarification to the question - hopefully this makes it easier to answer!
Your point is not unreasonable. However, I always shut down my home PC when I'm not using it, so it's getting rebooted a lot anyway (admittedly this is not true for my office PC). This way I can be sure I'm keeping up to date with updates, without having them interrupt what I'm doing.
That would be a hybrid of Adjacency List and Materialized Path, right? What scenarios would that be used in? It seems to me that getting all children with one query would be better served with Nested Sets/ Intervals and I don't see what you would want to store the adjacency list for as well?
Securewave doesn't allow the * in the middle.  Only at the end.  I'm trying to get info from the company that currently sells SW, but the version installed at my user's site is older AND no one can find the documentation
This doesn't work. The combobox will just show an empty text and changing it won't do anything.  I guess throwing in a converter here would be the best solution.
I would agree.  Why are you recreating the wheel because MS has already done it for you.  You are just spending more time writing code.
Until very recently, directory nesting depth was restricted by the OS. I doubt that you'll find directories that are nested more than a few hundred times (if even). The above code can take *much* more.
you got 4 answers in a minute..
I like the recursive approach, the risk of a stack overflow is minimum at worst.
Hey, Nick answered the question correctly; you should mark his response as the answer.
I would say that looking at the alternatives posted below, that the VB way doesn't look so ugly.
variables are never allocated inside the code segment; this way they wouldn't be write-able.
i just did that for the snippet--my production code actually from which i sourced this does not actually throw the exception, but a String constance json document for the client app to digest nicely.
Autohotkey is probably the best tool for keyboard remapping. You could map CapsLock to Control really easily and make it like that just for Emacs if you so chose. You can also make Shift+CapsLock work as CapsLock.  http://www.autohotkey.com/
can you give an example of where I would need to split the code based on refactoring or expansion?
Thanks Espo. I actually wrote that inkscape blog post! Although it "works", it's not a particularly robust solution.  I like the codeplex project though - I'll give it a look. Thanks.
How embarrassing :) Good thing maybe the SVG rendering engine could help you out though.
Glass pane to the rescue again.
I take it as a compliment. I've not been quoted to myself before!
As a nitpick, I'd say that the reference isn't actually null - it references bad memory.  Although it is a valid point that just because it's a reference, doesn't mean that it refers to something that's valid
That depends on what version of Flash you're talking about.  ActionScript2 is just syntactic sugar on top of ActionScript1, which is essentially JavaScript (both are ECMAScript).  It's very much a dynamic language.  ActionScript3 is both.  You can declare dynamic objects, though most aren't dynamic.
Thanks for the post...this sounds like the cause of the problem.
I understand your answer. But why didn't I get an ambiguity error in the first place?
good catch there--it really is an emotional response from the OP's coworker.  Addressing the warm fuzzies will probably be more productive that hard logic and metrics.  Maybe push the hashing algo choice onto the colleague so they have more buy in to the proper solution?
If you're actually planning on using that in production, enjoy your unintended side effects of sweeping contextless string substitutions.
> It's sad that "QA" has some stigma attached to it among developers, but it does. How true!  Its such a shame.  My stint as a QA person has completely changed the way I unit test/verify code before calling it done.  For the better.  ;)
I guess I meant to imply "strong development skills (for QA)" which may or may not be equivalent to developer coding skills.
Your queries can be optimized to remove the INNER JOINs on Company. Or would this be something SQL Server would do automatically?
Rebuilding the entire solution takes way too long.  I created a custom keyboard shortcut.  It's in Tools -> Customize -> Keyboard, not Tools -> Options -> Keyboard.
Yes, but then the embedded page gets cut off if it doesn't fit inside the iframe.
You have a very good point here.  I did not mention in the question, but this was his code -- he implmenented it this way.  Its now my code so I could change it unilaterly but I would prefer to allow him to save face/agree in case I need further help understanding the code...
This would work for about 99% of the time.  What happens if a file in another directory (other then the one having a lot of file changes) is the one that is skipped.  You would scan the one directory for changes but miss the single file change in another.
Yes, we are using SQL Server Express for a web app. We have the same application in classic asp using the same SQLExpress DB with no problems. This application is an upgrade of the classic version to a .NET version

We are very meticilous with NOLOCK and we use views to read the data with aliases and SPROCS to handle the CRUD as well as SubSonic.
Actually it was a real link - I was on the mistaken impression that onclick fired after onbeforeunload. Thanks.
I think point 2 is incorrect. See this example program:  http://pastebin.com/f5252f8a8  This implies that on gcc on my machine, the reference is implemented with a pointer.  Output: Size of class: 8 Value of ref before hack: 1 Value of ref after hack: 2 Value of ref after hack, with y changed: 3
Haha...your answer want here when I started mine. You beat me to it! :-)
If you feel my answer answers your original question, then finish this and start a new question. Either way I'll try to get the answer and post it here :)

Aargh! I can't believe I was that close
Just to be specific, "Flex Builder" is the name of Adobe's IDE and "Flex SDK" is the library.
Not really.  The language is ActionScript.  Flash and Flex are two different environments for creating SWFs.  You can use ActionScript in either or them, though Flex is more developer-oriented while Flash is designer-oriented.
mweerden,  The breadth-first traversal that I submitted will find ALL paths while avoiding any cycles.  For the graph that you have specified, the implementation correctly finds all three paths.
Flash is also a "development" side.  Flex and Flash are two different products that Adobe has for generating "Flash Content" (aka SWFs).
yeah, but that leaves me feeling cheap
You're making an unwarranted assumption that you have to use a generic Units enum instead of something more useful to the purpose, such as enum TemperatureUnits.
I don't see why this was voted down. All of those suggestions are relevant
I agree. Even if it is not exactly relevant here, they are valid and could be useful for others. Voting up..
I second that answer.  Its basically a shell extension type thing. I'm not sure if that meets your requirement for "standalone windows GUI application.
Use binary GCD method. Knuth reports 15% speedup (see, Art of Computer Programming, Volume II: semi-numerical algorithms)
Even more so - if it works in Chrome, it 99.9% will work in Safari too, and vice versa, since they share renderers (Webkit).
Did it help to solve your problem. Would be great if you can share your findings.
I didn't completely read your code and assumed you used a breadth-first traversal (because you said so). However, on closer inspection after your comment, I noticed that it is in fact not. It is actually a memoryless depth-first traversal like those of Ryan, Christian and Robert.
Why should VB want anonymous delegates when it has lambdas?  And yes, the next version will have multi-line lambdas and lambdas that don't return a value (= `Sub`s).
And if you purchase that domain I will never be able to look at you the same way again.
Hmm, although that seems very cool ... it doesn't seem to help the scenario of the automated build (unless I'm reading the docs wrong).
The app's installer is wrapped within a custom InnoSetup Installer. The InnoSetup installer, in turn, is manually executed by the logged in user. That said, the uninstall is trigged by a service running under the Local System account.  I'll try having the service install AND uninstall. Many thx.
This the difference between unit tests and integration tests.  You need both.  I shouldn't need a database to test how my code reacts to an incoming record set, but I do need to also test that my SQL brings back the right result.
Thanks - that's the answer I just found and you beat me to posting it back here!  :o)
I like that LINQ implementation. I really need to make the jump and get into LINQ soon...
What browser are you using? I tried in FF and got nothing, IE returned the parent FORM elements ACTION attribute.. I tried manually overriding the onmouse events to no avail.. Have you tested this?
Great insight - yes, this is the case, I am using a background image instead of an <img>
You're welcome.  Now I'm about to post my own question on the differences between count(column) and count(*).  :)
Is there a language in particular you are looking for an example in? C++?
I noticed the other day that this can be used to organize the whole project or parts of it, not just one file as I had expected. Extremely useful.
TortoiseSVN is not really a "Standalone Windows Client" because it integrates itself with Windows Explorer.  A standalone client would be one that is totally self contained and does not integrate with any other program They are useful for machines that you can't install or integrate on.
So you need a SQLDataAccessLayer like component. Unit tests for those have to hit the DB because DB-access is its reason for being. But components accessing IDataAccessLayer need to mock to keep their tests running sub-second fast. Testing end to end is more of in the realm of acceptance tests-FIT
What you are saying about not testing everything in isolation is incorrect.  You must do unit testing AND integration testing.  When you do, and your integration test fails or a bug is encountered, isolated unit tests quickly point to the problem by eliminating tested code which is not suspect.
Just curious: if you have a row with _all_ NULLs, would count(*) still count it, or is just count(column) for all columns?
Explorer integration is a big plus if you are using windows.
You can abuse Visual Studio in the same way.
Yeah, I found that article today and haven't been able to make it work for my particular situation. Perhaps I need to look into that further.
The clue is in the MFC tag :)
Perhaps you can post the code you are using that doesn't work?
It is pretty tedious, but you should be reusing your mock setup code just like you would production code.  That will ease the pain somewhat.
As usual, moderatin is key.  I think the tradeoff on how "isolated" you make your unit tests is always about ROI.    Good answer Gishu, would be great to see you blog about these OOAD/SE topics.
I assume this is a once-off operation and replication isn't an option?
Well put, sir! A much fuller and more articulate argument than mine.
No, it needs to be repeatable; long term we'll be specifying which items to copy (by PK in the original database, for instance).  Since we can't guarantee the order, PKs shouldn't need to be exactly the same in the new database.  Replication isn't out of the question if it's a good solution.
It's too bad my IDE (NetBeans) formats them horribly when it's auto-formatting.
Can you provide an example usage?
We'd prefer to stay away from DTS/SSIS if possible.  We're looking for something that (appropriately packaged in code) is easy for an end user to run by picking a set of items to import from a list.
When compared to the older stuff is simple
The code in question contains undefined behavior.  Technically, you cannot do anything with a null pointer except set it, and compare it.  Once your program invokes undefined behavior, it can do anything, including appearing to work correctly until you are giving a demo to the big boss.
Actually, since the onreadystate function I wrote assumed the XMLHttpRequest object as its context, you would want to use this.responseText or this.responseXML, as I indicated in the comment in the code.
The fullpath required for /logmsgfile seems to be why I was having problems with that particular command.  Thanks!
Most "old school" Java guys never bother to start using this feature, but I agree it's great.
I mean t takes to long for the server to comeback with results
I have to disagree with your second point, the amount of code written by this person will be significant it is just that most of the code written will not be in our products but will consume and make use of our products.
Hmm … what happens if this is `false`? No return value? Why the `if`s in the first place? Simply returning the expression works just as well.
You're right. I just added them to be explicit, but you could change your WHERE clause to:  WHERE Department.CompanyID = @CompanyID
Should the group by column and the one being counted be different? otherwise you would get nothing from this query
Does that mean COUNT('x') would be faster if the table had many columns, compared to COUNT(*)?
What DBMS are you using?  SQL Server?  MySQL?  other?
Because of the reasons you just stated - multiline statements, and functions that don't return a value. Good to know it'll be in the next version, but C# has had it since 2005.
I think this behavior depends on the database and the query optimization applied.  It's an obvious optimization to perform when you see COUNT(*).  It can only mean one thing, you want the total count of rows, regardless of how many columns the table has.
Why do you need the application vs. the shell extension? That would make it easier to answer this question.
with(new Resource() { public void do(Resource resource) .... reads slightly better. :-)
the .compiled files are in the BIN folder.  I have set the "Merge all pages and control outputs to a single assembly" option.  So, do you say that I don't need to FTP them?
Like I said, this is a simplification of what I'm doing, there are other changes that take place in the parameter and other flags that could be set.  I need to know how to work with a byreference parameter basically
This is possible, but now the amount of repeating myself in my code I'm doing loses any benefit and I'd just as well break up my code into N segments, one for each array (and then hardcode the array's name)
It's not correct to say there's not a difference between select(n) and select(*).  If you have a covering index that includes n, you get the data straight from the leaf level of the index and don't have to go back to the table, which is much faster.
That's what I was afraid of. I was just hoping that since I'm new to Ruby that there would possibly be some simple method name I just hadn't heard of yet.
I can confirm the IE8 Beta also displays the Form action. I think this was added as a security thing.. Who knows :)
The DBMS optimizer *will* realize this, and choose the correct index for the job. Provided there is an index, rare is the day that I've seen a DBMS actually **count** rows on the table. Moreover, the presence of NULLs often cause semantic bugs. When you want the # of rows in a table, use COUNT(*)!!!
No, I'm saying that because you see them at all your deployment probably isn't set up right.
The problem I'm having is when you do a 'puts var'. Doing a puts on an Array prints out the contents of the Array, not the name of the Array. My current code above is similar to yours (although I didn't use eval).
Careful:  I notice the author of the improved highlighter changed away from syntax sync fromstart in the most recent version... so the issue you saw may start happening in this highlighter.  Looks like in the past, it always did fromstart.
Every database has its own function for getting the current date, unfortunately.
Thank you, though the syntax is not exactly correct, its giving me a cannot convert lambda to delegate error, once I figure out the exact syntax I'll post it and mark your answer.
It can be made less tedious with tools like EasyMock.  Also some of Gishu's objections don't pan out if you organize your mocks correctly.  Google this: "Mocks Aren't Stubs"
Make sure you clear away whatever crufty files VSS leaves in your checkout before importing into SVN, and also make sure all the generated files are gone as well.
In your branches/cool_feature folders, do you branch the whole trunk or just certain sub-folders?
I'd prefer ItemListener (just make sure to check the ItemEvent to see whether it is a selection or deselection even).  The ActionListener can be fired even if the selection hasn't changed (i.e. if the user clicks on the already selected item).  This may or may not be what you want.
This is the best option, I'd say.  PayPal also lets you do this.
Those are methods, there's no possibility of naming conflicts unless I start declaring methods on the page tracker's prototype.
typically it's the whole trunk.  rarely does a feature only touch one directory.  i also highly recommend svnmerge.py if you aren't running svn 1.5.  makes the whole branch/merge process much nicer.
You may want to try switching Caps Lock and Control, if you haven't already.
In  my experience, this is patently false.  I've worked with queries that join dozens of tables, *each* containing 1million + rows, and as long as you're joining on primary keys, the results come back very quickly.
monkeypatches?  I have no idea what that means, but I could guess it refers to providing that method to most, if not all, objects
What's 'quickly'?  If you're running a website trying to serve thousands of pageviews a second 'fast enough' as an entirely different meaning than a single user database where all you're concerned about is response time for the user.
"as long as you're joining on primary keys, the results come back very quickly"  Well, yeah. But, in my experience with more tables, the more likely it is for joins to happen on non-pk's, non-indexed columns, etc.
My 2 cents: I have to disagree; doing that kind of optimization during design is a classic case of premature optimization.  Wait until you see that performance is a problem *before* you sacrifice a good design.
Normalisation and the subsequent joining of tables usually helps performance since by definition you can be more selective and avoid table scans - the slowest method of selecting.
Poor design is usually the biggest factor in poor performance, not normalisation.
New widgets are not being created in WidgetHolder; the members are references but the constructor arguments are copies.
SCMs are designed for merging lines of ASCII text.  That is not necessarily useful when merging calendars or other structured data.
Note that you lose the benefits of JITting when you use NGEN. One thing you can do is put the Form in an NGENed EXE and the rest of the application logic in a DLL that isn't NGENed.
It seems the WoW community uses that extensively ;)
This will dereference past the end of the array when the array is zero-length or only contains a single byte.
The thing is, most people aren't developers :)
No worries, you tried the best you could with the information given.  I'm scratching my head on it aas well... Aye, I am using Recordset.Update right now for the actual row updates as you said... I'll try using a directly generated Update statement instead and see how that works.
A Glass Pane does not work for my case, but maybe a good answer for someone else.
George, since the Expect.Call(...).Do answer was correct (only syntax error), I would appreciate a 1 up vote for my answer.  Thanks friend.
I don't know anything about the original developer I was handed it and said, we need to make these changes.  Good luck.
Ok, I'm not sure that saying "without reducing its usability" could mean "make it unusable" but I will edit this just to make it more clear.
Aye, I had a real-time data processing app and the joins killed the queries. I de-normalised the data and all was good, it gets integrated back into the normalised database at the end of the day when the number of requests chill out.
I take it you haven't used Google Analytics? *All* methods on the page tracker object are prefixed with an underscore, even those that explicitly stated as public in the documentation.
Google results aren't an answer<<I don't get. So then what is answer ? if you think of one ? with no guarantee ? or I should drop here actual links to mass of sites? I think that stackoverflow must have things in one place, not just links to other sites, that's way i posted all this into one thread.
Yeah.. I sometimes forget that. Developers are weird that way :-)
Did you mean '<cfset VAR foo = "bar" />'?
s/nth/(n+1)th/ run. Runs are counted from 1 (first run, second run, etc).
I don't see nothing wrong. I'm using a Web deployment project and deploying to a temp folder. All the compiled files are generated by the build.
And my example code does use the var keyword. So, um, I'm confused. :-)
Thanks, that's explained something that didn't seem to make sense to me before
Yes, the arguments takes precedence over the instance variable. I'm okay with that. It's consistent with other languages, where I would have to use this or self to reference the instance variable as opposed to the argument.
Good tip marxidad. if you can post it as an answer, one upvote from me :)
The idea is for the code to output valid XML even if I give it invalid XML, like what ET does.
I'm actually not convinced this is correct information. There are no recorded instances of any recovery from an overwrite that yielded more than 1% of valid data.
Government's with lots of money don't tend to publish their results.
Thinking in variables? What else could I think in? Some background. I know a little PASCAL and am using this as a project to learn Python.
I wasn't able to get this to work, i tried using the example on jquery's page with no success
Classic VB doesn't have a real ternary op either, just the IIf() function (immediate if).  But even that is still a function, so _all_ function arguments must be evaluated before passing to the function.
Are you serious? Mechanical Turks? Wow, the lengths some people will go to. I guess you might as well, humans will do just about anything for money...
All you did was take my answer, and remove the else clause.
Very close, but Jason had more details - up vote for you
Some people are evidently typing in CAPTCHAs to look at porn.
That's the local machine name. What I need is the network alias the domain server has attached to the machine.
LOL - rehashing? While you were answering, so was I. I had not idea you had answered it (we were only a minute or two apart). It's not like it is that unique of a solution, it is pretty much *the* way to do it. By the way, my comment about yours was an edit after I answered - you can see the history
That's a neat thing to think about.
It's not like there is a contest I am trying to win - what motivation would I have for copying your answer? Don't flatter yourself.
No, a coworker asked me about it because I studied some Probability, but I couldn't solve it
There is a degree of speculation in your comment. I have seen time and time again assumptions like these get tested and the exact opposite turn out to be true. The problem is many engineers will take info like this as  the gospel. Please folks, create test cases which reflect your real situations.
I assume we're talking integers only here?
This was an ASP.NET-specific question, but I don't think you should receive a downvote (I don't know who did it) for posting PHP solution - your idea is correct even if the language is not. :)
Sounds like something that could be circumvented should it gain widespread adoption. We want something that is fundamentally hard for computers to do.
Btw, you need to include a Script block within your string on RegisterClientScriptBlock, as per MSDN.
They are greater than 0, so not that big
You should clarify the integer restriction in the question.
By the way, the other proof I didn't copy yours is that you forgot about the script tags originally. If you look at my answer, I am using an overload of RegisterStartupScript which will include that automagically. :)
Take CSE566 at Ohio State and you'll learn all about this and other counting things. One of my favorite classes.
No, I don't. Maybe you need to read about the overload I used, as per MSDN. :)
If there is no top bound, it's clearly infinite. Even if a, b, and c are zero, you can still just choose d = x and e = -(d - 500) for all values of x >= 500.
Ah, missed the boolean at the end, that will learn me for not scrolling over the code.
LOL - nice. Never ceases to amaze me what workarounds people can think of...
why so many vote downs on the question?
If one of them is greater than 500, then it's impossible for them to add 500, since none can be negative...
Jason, put the "overload" explanation in your answer
I just might have to take Michael Haren's advice and walk on down the street to get the answer to this. ;)
@Kent: Read the part when it says a,b,c,d,e are all greater than or equal to zero.
YUI provides a [ToolTip widget](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/tooltip/) for cross-browser purposes.
the fact that it is hard for a computer to do is not relevant.  These things get farmed out to wage slaves in foreign countries to perform on a mass scale.  In the case of the invisi-captcha, the bot thinks it was successful, but the server throws away the response.  There is no input to farm out.
Why all the downvotes? I see nothing wrong with puzzles.
Roman, although I don't think an explanation should be needed, I added it for you.
It is true that your solution is agnostic, but the question, based on the way this was tagged, was specific to ASP.NET. Also, since my response was accepted as the answer, Roman is obviously using ASP.NET
So spammers use bots with Javascript enabled.   Using cheap labor of course is a work around for any CAPTCHA, but there will only be so much of that, and much less than the amount of spamming done right now.
I edited this question to reflect the true intent of roman's original question and which answer he selected as accepted, since there was some confusion as to the platform this question was targeted at.
See my comment on why I edited this question to provide more clarity. I left a comment on the original question.
awesome. i can already think of couple of them..
Fraps only records DirectX or OpenGL renderings such as games. Probably not best suited for general screencast recording.
I think a lot of people misread the puzzle.  The "integer" and ">=0" requirements make the puzzle doable.
So, the issue with this idea is that with a 7 MB header file, the substring Trie is about 600 MBs.
Wrong. The ISO SQL standard has specified recursive SQL since the SQL:1999 standard. DB2 and recent versions of MSSQL implement it. The SQL standard's recursive SQL is rather different than Oracle's CONNECT BY, by the way.
agreed. need to start with a bang. i wonder what would that be..
What are your migrations written in? Straight SQL? Also how do you handle configuration files?
Since the question mentions a 'registry hack', I don't think @A Salim is looking for a way to do this from a web page.
Which databases implement VARCHAR that way?
Actually, the "integer" and ">=0" requirements make the puzzle difficult.  Without either of those, the answer is easy: infinity!  With those constraints the answer is some finite number
Does there have to be 5 numbers, or are you interested in solutions with 2-4?
I'm interested in the solution for 5, but if the other solutions can help me figure it out then they are welcome (the solution for 2 is easy though: 501)
This would make it crystal clear for the next person looking for the answer, without having to read through the comments. thanx
That's no better, you might as well remove the statement outside the lock.  Also, if the only thing that is done here is to set initialized to true then the original "non-safe" ver. was good enough. At worst you set it twice, the only reason for the early return is performance (not correctness).
That part I know, looking for a A..Z integration test
This is very true.  Do you have any methods of finding potential bottlenecks?
This is a great honor..I am one of your regular readers. Actually, I had the link to your blog entry but removed it to avoid too many links on the question.
Falacy: "Mocks Make Tests Brittle": If you change your method signatures all the time, yeah this is a problem, but your method signatures should represent an interface which is a "contract" between two components.  Also, I don't find anything tedious about "Find/Replace".
I gave a solution before for arbitrary numbers of addends and sums.
Any suggestions on getting the two apps to talk to each other? I'll probably just use a database. Is there a easier way?
Falacy: "You test is now privy to insider implementation info": In their purest form, a Mock fakes an interface, and return expected results for interface methods.  When changing the way a method is implemented, the mock still works just fine, and the tests still pass. Because its an interface.
You're right, dynamic programming is best!  In my code solution above, I suggest using a cache table of pairs, but there's a LOT of pairs, so DP is better.  However I tried to work out the DP solution and it was too hard for little ol' me.  :-)
This answer + the GPM answer by Brian answers my question, but I can only select 1 answer.
Does the order of the variables matter? If it does then that needs to be taken into account in the solution.
Admitidly the original question was tagged asp.net, but it was not phrased as such. The problem and all but the accepted answer are language agnostic.  The accepted answer is correct in terms of the rephrased question but as with most .net stuff, protects the developer from the underlying mechanics.
The order matters: The answer should count both 500+0+0+0+0 and 0+0+0+0+50
Why not? When you say "element" you mean any Swing component? Or elements in a tree or list?
Actually just summand * sum pairs, so that's not so bad at 5 x 500.
In my code below I count the order properly.  That is, all permutations.
A great answer from Will Dean below.
This answers my question. Alas, I guess I will still use pop(), since iteration seems to sort the elements. I would prefer them in random order...
I don't think that the iter() is sorting the elements - when I create a set and pop() until it's empty, I get consistent (sorted, in my example) ordering, and it's the same as the iterator - pop() doesn't promise random order, just arbitrary, as in "I promise nothing".
Pedantry: *channel Pedantry: *difference
I'm not getting that same exception with the exact same code.
I would argue that Telerik is any good.  I have used them in the past and hated every minute of it.  But I am jaded.
This would be spcifically a LINQ to SQL bug as opposed to LINQ in general
@Chris. I did read that bit. There is no top bound specified, only a lower bound. Hence, any integer can reach positive infinity. Hence, there is an infinite number of permutations. Am I missing something?
Nevermind.  After reading the asker's clarification, I guess it was for a web application.
or you could get all the bytes in one shot with ReadBytes and also make use of buffering. but I guess that wasn't the question.
yeah, I'm sure you are right. Makes sense that it would not be in the linq language but in the interpreter to SQL.
That is my feeling about the state of things now-a-days, but it always seems like an argument you are not going to with with a DBA for some reason or another.
Have the DBA read Frans' article I posted as an answer :)
I think your updated comment to me seems like you still could do with some kind of build process that maybe pulls in those external binaries and runs sets of tests on them etc. I think I've been in your situation before and it's hard to see CI working until you've put something in place.
Please note that this is not a breadth-first traversal. With breadth first you first visit all nodes with distance 0 to the root, then those with distance 1, then 2, etc.
I've bookmarked it, so I have that in my back pocket now. But sadly, some things may not change since a) that is the standard operating procedure, and b) there is so much legacy in the existing set of procs, well, they're not going away any time soon.
thank you, that seems interesting. do you have any documentation link to share?
"most of the time, I will be debugging trough the code in Visual Studio" Doesn't really lend itself to slides.
What I did was implement the data access in my BAL.
What if I put my data access in my BAL?
That did the trick.  It seems odd that it worked by default for Visual Studio's built in web server, though.
I understand that there is volume, but I'm not sure I understand from this question why that needs to be handled in a special way? Are you looking to decrease hits on that table, improve the user exerience for feed consumers, or...?
Why would you want to do this?
I agree with Matt.  Your question needs clarification.  Are you simply wanting to know if member function pointers work with virtual functions?  If so, then the answer is yes.  If you are trying to ask something else, please clarify.
At which point we will just turn to de-assemblers just like they do for cracking the copy-protection on computer games.
Your code works in IE, you just need to "Allow blocked Content" in the Security Toolbar

That isn't a good idea. Array.IndexOf is basically a search with a worse case of O(n). Do that n times, can your total worse case becomes O(n^2).  In layman's terms, an array of 100 items could take up to 10000 comparisons.
This looks like the error you are having..  http://www.cto20.com/cto20/tabid/647/EntryID/53/Default.aspx
> This allows you to more easily change the backend physical data storage technology (move from XML files to a database, or from SQL Server to Oracle or MySQL, for example)  Does that ever actually happen as an afterthought? I doubt it.
> This way, if you have to change data stores, you don't end up rewriting the whole thing.  Are you every really going to change data stores? Unless you plan on it from the beginning, I doubt it.
Yes, sorry.. I hadn't noticed that they were the same column in the example.  I'll update the post.
Well, in some projects I do all the time. In my dev environment, I'm using SQLite, and in the production it's MySQL. The framework I'm using makes this easy though (Pylons).
Efficiency aside, if the array has duplicated items you'll get the index of the first one, not necessarily the one you're on. Consider an array of { 5, 14, 5, 29, ... }. When 'val' is 5 you'll always get zero even if you're on the third element.
It would be much more performant to do foreach(KeyValuePair<int, string> pair in items) and then reference pair.Key and pair.Value, rather than doing a lookup in each iteration.
The point to my post is that, when working with direct byte buffers, one can literally forget the difference between what is on disc and what is in memory and just concentrate on the algorithm.
It would be much more performant to do foreach(KeyValuePair<int, int> pair in values) and then reference pair.Key and pair.Value, rather than doing a lookup in each iteration.
@Grauenwolf: While changing databases is not that often, separating stuff is still "The Good Way Of Doing", what is more common in practice, you might and up in changeing the way you access your present data, or tweak some functionalities, and have it all in one place.
flightInfo.Soap -- same as before.  This was actually generated by the web service template.
I'm pretty sure this is what I tried first, and it didn't work. I don't really have time to re-test it, though, so I may be wrong.
And the assembly is still flightInfo?
You're quite right about not waiting until the class is finished.  I was overtaken by the urge to complete the functionality.
Have you tried Moonlight[1]?  It is suppose to be an implementation of silverlight for Linux/Unix.  [http://www.mono-project.com/Moonlight][1]
It's certainly possible that there's a parsing bug in the VB (2005) compiler.  However,  I wasn't able to reproduce this with the 2008 version.
Useless. They'll still do it - I've had nofollow on for over a year and I still get plenty of comment spam attempts.  Their bots are indiscriminate and do no checking for nofollow.
@Ethan no, but thanks for the suggestion!  It's nice to know there is a way to use it, but I still don't have high respect for a product that wants to be fully pervasive and doesn't support all major platforms from the provider (in this case MS)
Rich, the best part about the LINQ implementation is not only is it concise, it's also just as efficient as the 2.0 version, since it works against IEnumerable.
Mike, totally agree.  I really like the idea of Silverlight, its ties with Visual Studio are really awesome, but it has quite a way to go before it is mature enough for primetime use.
yeah, on top of that I think Joel and Jeff (in the podcast) are dead on that both silverlight and flash have a huge competitor... JavaScript, which is already more pervasive than both, and a serious option now
Yeah, I had never really thought about it before they mentioned it in that podcast, but they are very right.  I think the next couple of years will definitely be interesting in that competition.
If I'm not mistaken, Pinvoke is for running code within other dlls, I'm looking to embed an exe in the same dll (or even exe) as the currently running code.
Number 2 is *not* true.  A references is not simply "another name for the same variable."  References may be passed to functions, stored in classes, etc. in a manner very similar to pointers.  They exist independently from the variables they point to.
Also this: "A pointer has its own memory address and size on the stack".  Pointers need not be allocated on the stack (and most of them are generally not.)
NBC Olympics did that... which really made me mad, regardless of the fact that I didn't know Moonlight existed and might be an option, I would still rather have a message say "You might not be able to view this" rather than blocking outright
What version of Java is causing the exception?
If you changed your manually executed installer to be per-machine, that would probably also work. But it would require the installing users to have local admin rights.
Both actually, tables, lists, trees, components.  But we also use drag and drop also, which adds another level of issues.  Another issue is we have multiple independent windows for our application.  Ideally if we could set it up on the L&F, but I haven't figured that out yet.
I second the vote for PowerShell.  It gives you just an extremely capable shell.
You're absolutely right. I haven't kept up with changes since 1.5.2, and amn't overly familiar with iterators and related functions. (Stack Overflow has taught me much already.) Thanks for the suggestion. I made it my own. :-)
As soon as I could install the release of SP1 on my work machine and throw an hour at it.
I'm definitely interested in how this technique would work. You don't have to go into great depth, but some further details would be very helpful -- especially on how you map the conversion process to what is stored in the DB.
sorry, I should have added that when I add index.html to C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\htdocs, I get the message, "The requested URL /htdocs/index.html was not found on this server."
No problem. BTW, I think localhost/index.html maps directly to "C:\Program Files\Apache Group\Apache2\htdocs\index.html"
So the documentation is correct, which makes it seem like Win32 is in error. What a pain.
And the same in 'c' with printf and '\r'.
Let me leave a better comment.  _Researchers_ have shown that it's possible to recover significant information from a magnetic disc that has been overwritten more than once.  That doesn't mean it's easy, or that it happens regularly, but that _it's possible_, so it's worthwhile to take extra care.
The problem with type in this situation is it adds unwanted file headers when typing more than one file specified on the command line.
Would it be fair to say that the disadvantage to this technique is that the permission definitions are in the enum, and so access to the application is required to understand what gets placed in the database?
Your question isn't very clear.
When specifying more than one file on the command line, type outputs a few blank lines and the name of the file, before copying the contents of the file. Try it :)
I think you have a typo in your post -- shouldn't varchar2(1000) be CHAR(1000) ?
Thanks for the input -- I'll give it a read.  Looks a bit math heavy, but not terribly complex.
I actually knew about this one, and I was curious about the alternatives. For now, I'll accept your answer.
Ah, I hadn't noticed that the headers go to stderr. Good to know.
I don't plan to implement the stored procedures using the CLR capabilities of sql 2005, rather plain vanilla tsql.  Or are you saying that tsql now supports try...catch?  If so, great!
"Funk Soul Brother" is, of course, "The Rockafeller Skank"  ;)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rockafeller_Skank
Looking at this again, you should really check and see if the image index is in the bounds of the imagelist.images count before you increment it.
Check the permissions by right-clicking on it and hitting the security or permissions tab.  Is the Excel file closed when you connect to it?
Sorry I put up this question before I had sanitized code.  The color is being applied to the ListViewItem background not the ListView.  I'll post a sample in a second.
No random caps there. Apparently I was mistaken on the g though, I see.
I cannot definitively tell you why.  I can only say that WebDev.WebServer.exe is meant to be a a stripped down HTTP server.  It doesn't offer all of the same authentication options, etc.  So it wouldn't surprise me that it uses integrated auth only.  What about if you use firefox, same result?
IE7+ supports the :hover pseudo selector on all elements.
Why would you want to use these hidden undocumented keywords.  They are likely hidden and undocumented for a reason, meaning they could change at any time.  In my opinion this is risky.
This is not a feature of C#, but rather of the System.Web.UI.Page class.
Why would you want to use a keyword as a variable name?  Seems to me that this would make code less readable and obfuscated.
That's great thanks.  Any idea of the requirements for a simple justifiable macro to create as an exercise then?
Unknown I was posting this on behalf of a coworker who has not joined SO yet.    You are right, there is no sharepoint in this code, this is a stripped down sample.  The production code does interact with a sharepoint document library.  I should have made that more clear.
What exactly makes this a programming question?
+1! It worked, but it's a little buggy. If you drag the tab too it makes a mess.
He's talking about http://beta.stackoverflow.com/tags
I can see your point on another site, but this one already has a significant tag popularity infrastructure in place.  Just click on the "Tags" tab and it lists them by popularity.
That's close, but it is apparently a text search not a tag search.  I was thinking along the lines of delicious.com's tag search paradigm, "tag1 tag2 tag3", which would return all links tagged with those three tags.
Instead of using inheritance, it is much better to just declare the two troublesome methods as private. Saves an inclusion of boost if you don't want to bring it in, and using inheritance (both minor costs, but good to know)
Yes SQL 2005 adds support to T-SQL for "exception" handling, but I didn't link to MSDN :)  Search for BEGIN TRY.
That would be a fair statement, though you could define the values in a table in the database as well (though you wouldn't be able to use a foreign key..). This "disadvantage" is true of any integer-based enum in the database.
I have partial-completion-mode switched on so for yank-rectangle I can use M-x y-r [tab] [ret] but you're right, the default shortcuts are quicker.
If that's a problem you can always go with row-based roles (and a many to many relationship).
Your title question and your description question are not totally in sync.  type would be the best answer for the title question and copy /b would be the best answer for the description question.  You might want to change that title if possible.
We have something of that kind for final testing, but it doesn't save from the need for developers to have recent libraries. Anyway, I understand the urge to point out faulty process, but the question concerns tools and techniques for versioning and distributing binary files.
This appears to be just what I need, I can insert a ToggleButton inside the stack to add the Pin functionality without needing to create any custom controls or breaking keyboard use. Thanks :)
Let me see if I can write up a blog post.. articulating my feelings a bit better :) Watch this space...
Thanks for the suggestion.  It sounds very useful and I'll definitely check it out.
if you're a C# junkie: this book is also available tailored to C#. It's called Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#.
except that you can't when your dealing with more then 4 gigs of data, which is the case.
Thinking about it now, that does make sense, running a regexp on a line with no matches is the same as running a check first to see if it matches at all. You get the same result!
It is true, that sphinx uses docs written independently  from source code as a base, but using the autodoc extension one can easily include docstrings from python modules. Because of its dynamic nature I find hand written documentation for python modules more useful than generated api docs.
Very similar but if you're using shared hosting you wouldn't be able to add the mapping extension.  By adding aspx you should be golden for any site that runs 3.5
I also spiked the original SvnBridge implementation, but I don't think any of that code survived :)
P.S. C++ is horrible. Did I mention that? Not like, "write songs and be a moderately successful villain who can't get the girl" horrible, because that's fun, but the "walking on glass in your bare feet" horrible.
I did say that the first check is for performance. Locks are very expensive so it's always worth doing. On the second point, I think it's reasonable to assume more complex code has been omitted. I somehow doubt MS would go to the expense of a lock unnecessarily.
CruiseControl as far as I remember already has the ability to display the build results as a website so that function is already taken care of, and as you are already exposing it using dyndns or no-ip you can also access the build results.
I guess that works, but I'd never do that.  It's screaming bad practice. Think about code readability etc.. Come back to your code in six months and figure out all the function calls inside your HTML markup.
<? $var1 = "I\'m including {$var2} in this variable.."; ?>  Why are you escaping a single quote inside double quotes? ;)
"use them all the time, unless you have a very good reason not to" this is like telling people to wear helmets all the time, unless they have a good reason not to.
That is assuming that using transactions is annoying or ridiculous in any way, which I don't think is the case.
I think @Jeff Atwood did not read the full para before coming to the conclusion of donning helmets.
I want to second the book recommendation. It's really awesome.
On your point about roll your own logins that: "...the user's mailbox is a) unavailable due to a typo, b) full or c) provider is 'down'." This is true, but if there email account does not work, they can also not signup for open id.
"I usually don't fall over when walking" is a very good and sensible reason not to wear a helmet.  "I use a ORM that handles optimistic locking for my long running business activities" is a very good and sensible reason not to use (long living) transactions.  "I don't know" isn' a good reason.
Ethan is totally correct. This so depends on the implementation you're using that without references to actual (Product,Version) it's completely useless.
It's a non issue if you have OpenID. ;) And as I said, the chances are not too bad. Aside from the ones advertised on the link I gave you, there are many, many more.
It is code that most people have written multiple times, but I agree it is a benefit.
"It encourages users to sign-up to OpenID... ...and hopefully to evangelise it themselves."  I agree that this is a way to push a particular technology (which is interesting given StackOverflows goal of being technology agnostic in content).  The fact is that it does not "encourage", it forces.
Can you clarify why you want to do this? Perhaps there are alternative solutions to taking screenshots.
The email problems are only a one-time signup issue.  My Technorati open-id has had problems 2-3 times in the last few days and I have not been able to sign in to Stack Overflow.  The failure point is there everytime you logon.
Very interesting, I will definitely have to start looking into that. I don't really properly write unit tests for this reason, and it is a bad practice I need to eliminate.
\ is not necessary   This works:   <a href="javascript:uncheckEl('tagVO-$id', $(this))">
Hehe... I wasn't sure about escaping it. I look for the \ so long on my mac keyboard. It was sorta annoying. ;)
Excellent link there. For some reason, it didn't occur to me to Wikipedia it. :)
Have you tried wrapping the list view updates in BeginUpdate()/EndUpdate() brackets? Maybe the -1 trick works when you specifically end the update, triggering a recalc of the way the list view is displayed.
Hey Tim - can you tell us what language you plan to use? Maybe we could narrow it down and solve this question. Or if it has been solved, let us know.
Your OP says 800MB, not 4GB.  :S    Is moving up to a 64-bit OS an option?
Well, my main idea was to generate the HTML on the local machine, then push the generated HTML to the web server. That way you don't have to worry about port-forwarding, and the machine always being up, or your connection dying
Thank you. Yes, I don't understand it myself either. It's quite useful in several situations where other pre-fab caching solutions don't apply.
i've updated the answer with modern 64-bit general purpose CPUs addressable memory info.
I don't see the benefit from this pattern over just calling the methods directly: SMTP().do_HELO('foo.bar.com') OK, there can be common code in the lookupMethod, but since that also can be overwritten by the subclass I don't see what you gain from the indirection.
That's the question, can you tell distutils that a given folder should be interpreted as a package, even though it doesn't have a __init__.py file. I could always create the __init__.py files when building the distribution, but I was wondering if you could do that with distutils.
Yes, there is a technique for telling distutils (and any other Python code) that a folder is a package: put an __init__.py file in the folder.
You give out your CC# just like that? Or your phone? Nice, free CC#'s and spam via txt. Not like there is an entire industry living off of those scams already.
But all the _really_ cool stuff isn't visible!  Well, mostly.  I loves me some algorithms!  OM NOM NOM NOM NOM...
@David I believe Codeslayer's main message is saying start with the assumption you need them, and look for reasons not to use them. What are those reasons? Florin shows some. If you don't know what your code is behaving like, you have worse problems than the usage or not of transactions
Scriptaculous is an ADDON to prototype. Which is why they work well together.
I am my own openid provider.  If there's a problem _I_ can fix it.  But even then, if you choose a reliable provider (just like choosing a reliable web host) then you shouldn't have problems.  Until there's wide acceptance, though, providers who do it on the side aren't going to work at reliability.
One of the stuffs most people dont understand is that writers always have an exclusive lock whether they are part of an explicit transaction or not..
Font rendering on OS X isn't done by Cocoa, it's done by CoreGraphics. It's highly doubtful that Safari has any sort of "internal version of the Cocoa libraries" bundled, as that would require a Yellow Box implementation.
Exactly. I'm assuming that if the guy asked is because the thing is sensitive and they have reasons to, not because they are paranoid wankers...
That's a valid option too and what I used to do.  Why don't you post that as an alternative answer?  BTW, better is subjective... the boost::noncopyable method yields a compiler error with a specific line number.  Your method yields a link-time error which can be harder for newbies to track down.
I want eligant but of course I can accept hacky.  I'll try it today and see if it works, this looks real promising.
this is a great response, but you should note that it has to be *parameterized* SQL -- plain vanilla "build a giant string with replacements" SQL doesn't tend to perform as well.
That's a functional test, which I already have. Looking for an integration test.
I'm looking at having the user roughly design what they want, a bit of a sketch and a bit of a drag 'n drop of objects. I then want this "design" to be used as some part of the instructions in a production process. It is definitely a user-involved step, nothing clandestine here :)
Oh sure, show me up by giving more detailed information.  ;-D  Upvoted!
Mark - this must be over my head; I don't understand any of the stuff about headers. Does this method allow you to another page while the download starts?
It's a pain to maintain though. But then again, if it is a library class the methods should not be changed much anyway.  The code I'm looking at seems to be taking the safe road and using pimpl everywhere.
Actually there is a trick to keep track of attributes ordering. Look at Django ORM fields (http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/db/models/fields/__init__.py#L59).
This is simply a matter of convention, I think. When I see an uncatched exception, millions of thing might have caused it. When I spot a failed assert, I know I screwed up myself and it's easier for me to find the cause.
Basically what you're doing is reading the binary contents of the file and sending that binary data to the Browser instead of HTML.  The Content-Type just tells the browser what sort of file it is.  Try creating a simple page that's just my code snippet and plug in a file-name & content-type.
I found it after spending almost a day perfecting my own pw gen code. Image how I felt ;)
Dealing with support questions related to OpenID might be worse than dealing with username / password related questions. Not only because it's something most users never experienced before, but also because there's more things that could go wrong.
Gishu, I want to add one more comment: If Mocks are done WRONG, you are right on all counts, but if done RIGHT, then most of your objections disappear.  I'll be eagerly awaiting you blog post, but try to give a fair treatment of mocks as a tool. Your post above seems a bit one sided.
So what you are saying is the global memory used by _instance is initialized to NULL, one other global variable calls instance() allocating instance #1, then the explicit _instance initializer executes, setting it back to NULL, and the next call to instance() allocates a second time?
Exactly the answer I was looking for: it can be done with distutils, but you shouldn't.
you can write &amp; in place of the ampersand instead of escaping the code in your example
Not sure why the parent got modded down, but it might be a good idea to use URI in place of URL depending on what you're doing. See: http://www.symphonious.net/2007/03/29/javaneturl-or-javaneturi/
Thanks! Do you think, that it will be better to write some class, where will be defined the MyCreateFile() method, and then Ctrl-H All CreateFile calls in the code?
yes, it is all about changing the code, not hacking import tables :) thanks.
Some handy content types to know are  application/zip pplication/pdf application/octet-stream application/access application/msword application/vnd.ms-excel application/vnd.ms-powerpoint image/gif image/png image/jpg
Well it would be strange to have a method GetA() that returned void to begin with.  A more reasonable example would be obj.UpdateA().GetA() which makes perfect sense to me
As I mentioned in a previous comment, MapDialogRect doesn't work for non-dialog windows, so I guess I have to try the GetTextExtentPoint32 and GetTextMetrics functions as suggested.
Thank you, URLClassLoader seems like just what I wanted. I'll just need to make sure I can keep the signing chain intact.
My assignments records are one-record-per-student, as there are fields such as "notes" which are student-specific.  If I understand your answer correctly, this will allow you to select multiple names on the form, but the ajax request will remain unchanged.
Ctrl+T will only take you back if you got there using a tag.  If you searched it without using tags Ctrl+T will take you back to the place you were before you searched for your last *tag*
@Jeff Atwood: Good point; edited comment to reflect the nuances of stored proc vs. parameterized vs naked
I must admit I do not understand your comment Keng!
I will have to check this out.
Is it accurate then to say that Visual Studio will not be enough and when the new version of Expression Blend becomes a commercial product you will need to buy that, too, similar to how one needs to buy Flash from Adobe today?
How do you people find some of this stuff? There must be a lot of money to be gained by people breaking these CAPTCHAs.
Note that GPM will probably not interact comfortably with X active on the same terminal... read the end of the man page "BUGS" section carefully.  Even if it looks workable, I'd go to the X server for both kinds of event.
You wouldn't know what method to call in advance, that is to say 'HELO' comes from a variable. i've added usage example to the original post
You ignored part of the question. 'The site-initiated download should be similar to sites like download.com, which say "your download will begin in a moment."'
I agree that putting the constant on the left guards against a missing = sign ... but I've never been able to adopt it.  Code just reads more naturally the other way around.  Fortunately most compilers have a setting to warn about "if (a=b)" constructs.
Expression Blend is primarily for designers. So, if you need professional looking UI for a commercial product using Silverlight, you will have to use Expression Blend. But, I feel for typical line of business apps, Visual Studio should be good enough.
Yes, I would suggest you do that.
Basically just do what ChrisN suggested.
This is one of the reasons I like VB.Net.  If statements don't accept assignments, and you can just use the = sign for assignment and testing for equality.  It makes some code a little more verbose, but means that a lot of these bugs just can't happen.
So the question then is what does global memory look like prior to initialization of global data members...
Someone with access to the DB though could still have access to the account.  They would just need to rename the username temporarily.
Thanks for your response, I've started building some static compilation prototypes, so we'll see how things go :)  I will say, I wasn't expecting a response from someone at MS on a fairly obscure site -- good to see :)
Brian, is there a reason that you can't use GIFs instead?
Only problem with this approach is that you need to know what classes are in what jars. As opposed to just loading a directory of jars and then instantiating classes.  I am misunderstanding it?
currently date and time is collected from the user via a datetime picker javascript... however, when javascript is turned off, then the user can simply enter anything to the system and fails...
A little more information if you please... Do you want to control the transparency of your main application window ? Winforms 2.0 or WPF land ?
Derek a pointer is a variable just like any other one. On an x86 system it is 4 bytes.  These 4 bytes are on the stack. I didn't claim what they point to are on the stack.
Yeah. I know how to do it in SQL (I posted that answer in http://beta.stackoverflow.com/questions/19412/how-to-request-a-random-row-in-sql#19568) but was searching for a SQLAlchemy specific solution.
Patrick you are wrong.  The constructor is creating new widgets and then the references are references to those new widgets. He is not getting references to his original widgets.
If the subject read: "What is a magic number in terms of source code" then the tags shouldn't be there.  But he did not specify this.  So having my extra information is good.  I think Kyle, Landon and Marcio are wrong.
There was also no way to determine which one he was looking for.  Since I was the first post I couldn't guess which one he was looking for.
Consider a new title, like "How do you validate pending changes individually?" or something.  I find the use of "clean" confusing.
In VC++ it will increase the size, not sure about other compilers.  But if they do chose to make it inline I'm sure it would make it larger too.
by they I mean the compiler in question.
Yes, the size increment was the major one i heard of.. curious to know if there are more!
Is there any benefit to using the salt as well if it is also stored in the DB?
As of now, there just aren't that many books available on this topic ... you might have better luck looking on the web.
One further tweak that I have seen and appreciate is use of FIXED types and "USE BEST" types. i.e. typedef unsigned char UINT8      typedef unsigned uint255; uint 255 specifies the range of the values, but lets the optimum size be specified per system
Weird question since a long running query can potentially cause more locking.
Comments as documentation in Python is bad. Comments are for a module maintainer (why and how implemented). All documentation should be in docstrings (how to use).
I'm sorely tempted to post another question containing nothing in the body save a link to your post. :-,  Seriously, is it so hard to summarize what you're asking in a way that doesn't depend *entirely* on external links?
It's entirely targeted to those who know the terms already. The links are just to add info for those who may be interested in their meanings.
Your dictionary implementation can instead use a standard dictionary and a list - the dictionary stores the key->value associations, and the list stores keys in the order they are inserted.
Vault is also free for one developer (or at least has been in the past).
I'm not looking for a different shell interpreter, it's the application itself I loath.  Cygwin suffers the same problems and I got the impression somewhere that Windows PowerShell does as well. Is that impression wrong?
do you have any examples of this?
Could you correct the "lyfe-cycle" tag? ;)
Yes, powershell's got the same problem.
Because I already have the d3d9 stuff for everything I need, I just want the option to extend to other API's. Since I already have classes wrapping most d3d stuff (eg Texture, Sprite, Mesh), I could just overload those, leaving the actaul objects with API independent stuff.
@Joseph `type` can replace only part of `cat`'s functionality (due to distinction between binary and text files on Windows).
I would recommend GetGnuWin32 (to simplify installation)
Just reread my response, any loathing was directed at windows, and not you for being helpful :)
Thank you very much. That >(...) - concept is new to me.  Note: It doesn't seem to work under Window's cmd, PowerShell and not even cygwin's bash.
I'm not sure how to do it in PowerShell... It doesn't work in cygwin's bash for me either, I wonder whether it's a known limitation or a bug!
I could make a program/script but surely there is already something made.
long running queries should be created in a manner where locking is minimalized.
SQL Server 2008 includes a very complete resource governor.
Java also has introspection, but it's extraordinarily verbose.  However, you can take a Java class and discover what methods it has or what annotations exist for its functions, etc.  Just be prepared to write 20-30 lines of code to do what Python could do in 1-5 lines of code.
Yeah, I left checked exceptions out of my answer because of this argument.  However, I'd say that Java has some bad decisions about what's checked and what's unchecked in the standard library.  This doesn't discredit them as a language feature, but it can make Java programming a lot more annoying.
My point is, you're essentially using the terms as macros to avoid actually stating your question, and it suffers for it. I'm not really up on big-A Agile, but TTBOMK there's nothing that *requires* you to wrack up technical debt. Presumably, you have a type of scenario in mind - state it!
How do you prevent another connection from entering a row with that value inbetween when you check from when you insert?
accepted this over Toran's just because i had no idea that <asp:HiddenField> existed. always used <input type="hidden" />
I suggest starting a new question with the subject that interests you most, referencing this question. That way it can cover each subject more deeply, if there are experts around
I think you meant | instead of >.  Using > will write the output to the file.
You have to be careful about your conclusion here. Even a very small leak can cause massive fragmentation of the heap. Think of each 1-byte  leak malloc() that is not freed as bullet hole in the heap. The blocks  immediately adjacent can never coalesce.
I disagree with this idea. Increasing the size of all allocations creates INTERNAL fragmentation. If you can waste memory, it is better to just increase the total size of the heap - which by itself might avoid fragmentation from becoming an issue. ie: The heap unstability is avoided completely
I think this answer combined with Michael Ratanapintha's answer about using shift-right click in vista and 2008 answers this question fully.
This is a loop and looping is bad in sql. :) I kid.. I kid.. Love this answer.
Aku, thanks for the response. I'd be happy to elaborate, but I'm not sure what else to convey to help people give better answers.
Pedantry: JavaScript doesn't have classes. It is possible to have functions that are accessible to members of an object but otherwise inaccessible.
Sorry man, I can't help you any further.  Still sounds like a permissions issue though, if you can get it working from the shell.
Thanks anyways. It seems like a permissions thing to me too, but I don't see how that's possible here.
Yep, tried it and it ends up being parsed the same and gives the same error.
Tried changing `$db = new PDO('sqlite:test.db');` to a full path? Like..  `$db = new PDO('sqlite:/tmp/test.db');` ?
Just tried that, no difference. Thanks for the suggestion though.
I agree that this can be a good place to start, but after a while I've found that it gets a little conflicting with itself. It wants to remove indexes it has created for a previous tuning attempt.
A big reason to use D is if you are wanting to use abstraction but not lose access to the low level. You can actually build abstractions on top of ASM if you are nuts enough to try it.
I'm unclear how managed c++ attains a higher level of abstraction.  Blub with managed memory is still Blub.
It is not about C++. It is about learning .Net and then it makes it easier for learning other .Net languages like C#, VB.Net etc
Some developers could argue that it's better to wrap things up manually in HttpContext.Response rather than throwing an exception which is quite expensive operation in .NET books.
The problem with my approach is that I'm keeping the file open and flushing it all the time. And, I guess, opening and closing the file at every write would be cumbersome.  Your idea of a MultiWriter is very clever, though :)
Actually, I never call Close(), I just let Dispose() and the 'using' construct _do the right thing_.  If you aren't calling Dispose, then you need to be calling Close in an exception-safe manner.  It might be a good idea to add exception handling to the finally block.
Very nice idea! Indeed what I need is a logger. That way I can store much more information than what is simply shown to the user (and bug him much less).  Many times the best solution comes from a different approach, coming from someone external to the problem.
Right, my comments were for SqlClient specifically.  The point is, you need to understand the classes you are using.  Always calling Dispose isn't necessarily the right answer.
Yet another one of those questions that can't be answered.  You're going to see posts that are all over the place, and all of this has been discussed before.
You can do exactly same things with EasyMock as well.
Esteban, I mean there are a lot of different esource types, what resource you want to extract?
The slow tests you are talking about are integration tests.  This is why you should keep your unit and integration tests separate (though they often rely on the same testing tools).  Run unit tests very often because they are fast.  Run integration tests at intervals to get a reality check.
It is good to know this but this isn't any better than what I wrote (using the breakpoints window to remove the breakpoint permanently). I was looking for an easier solution, not one that made me stop everything for it to work. I was hoping there was a preference to change to something like Shift F9
Powershell uses the same command shell host so it doesn't solve these problems.
I would suggest retitling this as "terminal" is not the right word in regards to the windows command shell. On a unix system the command shell and your terminal application are essentially the same, on a windows system they are not.
But that snippet sets the header and footer heights at fixed values. I need them to expand vertically along with theirs contents  (see the extended description provided in the question)
I think this is in large part due to Javascript's OO-ness being entirely prototype based rather than the class based OO of the more popular languages. Also, JS is sparse on OO syntactic niceties, which can be a real turn off, especially if you're learning.
Conventional wisdom the with statment is to be avoided.  If the user object didn't have one of the properties you mentioned, the variable outside the with block's pseudo-scope would be modified. That way lies bugs. More info at http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/04/11/with-statement-considered-harmful/
We've changed our increment method to an ajax post - although users without javascript won't affect a question's view count, we didn't want to have a bot blacklist, either!
Yes Fowler's book is really good.  Maybe I should dig it out more often! :)
It would be better if the code ran under all OS's.
So could you swap 2 user's passwords by moving the password hashes in that file?
Thanks, I'll try it out tomorrow, when I'm back at my work place.
I think in this case it might be overkill to use a 3rd party library when it may take only a small amount of work to add the necessary functionality to the system.
Agreed, but I would suggest not using MD5 if SHA-1 is available.  MD-5's vulnerabilities are well documented--SHA-1 is 'better'.
As an aside, I'm going to have to move to vista on my work pc to use IIS7.  Fun fun fun.  It only takes about two days to install everything.
I don't recommend this approach in general, because it overrides _all_ imap connections to be imaps. Sometimes choice is a good thing, especially if the program is to be used for connecting to just Gmail.  However, if you think plain IMAP is outright wrong, then this approach is acceptable. :-)
...used for connecting to _more than_ just Gmail, I meant. :-P
Fernando,  The classpath is generated by Maven in the manifest file and it works fine on windows machine.   Anyways I will post the class-path entry in manifest file on Monday.
Maybe if you quantified "moderate size" and "slow" with actual numbers then people would be better able to advise?
If anyone is still reading this question, I've managed to get my class down to about half.  I wrote it again using TDD.  There's still some refactoring to do.  Note to self: Always use TDD even when prototyping.
Brilliant, thank you. I wish I could accept/merge both answers.
Really, waterfall with a 9 year span, are you sure? Waterfall is not incremental, I mean, you deliver to the client once in waterfall model.
All I want is to see/connect to my virtual machine from my vista host. Isn't it s way with Dynamic IPs?
Do you need CSS and html for a 4 column layout? If you do let me know, I already have it here.
Out of curiosity, how this factorial function can help to answer on given question?
I agree that log4net is a pretty heavy dependency to take here.
Deleting my answer to reduce clutter. 'Namespace Alias Qualifier' - now that name is something I would have never have figured out to use as a search keyword. :)
Yep, it's a very good example of Single Responsibility Principle violation. But it's too fun to show it to you colleagues and hearing "Wow!, FTW?!"
Heh! I'm outrun you this time 8-)
Damn. 2 times in 5 minuttes :) .  What is the "best practices" on this sort of thing, should i delete my answer?
I'm just bored to death today. SO is a great fun!
I will let my answer stay then. Although we both had the same answer, mine has a different link that some day might help someone.
It worked after the parent (loader) applet was signed. But the child (loaded) jars, even though they are signed, don't get security permissions.
Except HTML can handle it. What can't handle it is CSS.
Your gateway/router actually has (at least) two IP addresses. Are you looking for the one facing your node or the other(s) facing upstream towards other networks?
edit request: please fix the title.
Glad you found it. I just found it the other day, too, looking for the same thing. Too bad you can't accept your own answer!
This isn't for memory consumption, but rather for speed. Sealed classes are faster to load and call since you don't have to consider their methods might be overridden.
Unfortunately, as I commented on jassuncao's answer, the loaded applet so far doesn't have the appropriate permissions.
I'm not sure this should be the accepted answer since, as the poster points out, it has other side-effects, which may well be undesirable. It's also not true, at least as far as I can verify. Can you post a link to a working example?
Your 'clearer' div class doesn't match the '.clear' selector used in your css.
Can you be more specific? Exactly what can't CSS handle?
If you need more details, you can also examine trace output (use `SET AUTOTRACE ON` in Oracle). This will let you see things like physical reads, etc. I'd only use it after following roman's advice, though.
Konrad mentioned "three-column layouts" cannot be achieved in HTML. Tables very easily achieve this. It is a similar story with 100% height elements and vertical alignment. CSS tends to fail hard in these situations and rather than working the standard to how people work they criticise the design.
You fixed it! Thank you! The script has been more or less a line-by-line copy of Grant's script, which performs its SQL statements in this manner. I am, however, looking into doing an O(1) SELECT and queueing the UPDATES and executing them at the end.
I believe the standard **is** being enhanced - the "advanced layout module" of css3 (http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-layout/) will give us much of what we require here. Granted, it will be some time before CSS3 is widely supported. K only said that 3-column layouts cannot be achieved "WELL" in HTML.
Strictly speaking, a form is (almost) never a table. What would be the column heading for the data - "input fields"? By that argument, you could claim anything is a table: a paragraph is a single-celled table... Form support is pretty nasty, mainly because browser-manufacturers disagree on stuff
Exactly the same way you locate any other application window?
As the accepted answer stated, use alias but try to be consisted across the entire code base (just one alias for one namespace / class and they should be easy to distinguish).
I don't see origin defined as a special keyword for git-diff or git-rev-parse. Did you mean that I need to plug in the hash from step #1 as the value for origin? If so, how do I programmatically extract that value? I'd like to combine all these steps into a single command/script for convenience.
Print the header & footer on the PrintDocument yourself?
I don't think the NDA is your problem, maybe the License & Terms of Use of the iPhone ;).
I'm not doing anything that a typical desktop user can't do with their computer.  There are plenty of legitimate reasons for a user to run a program that requires elevated privileges.  I'm not trying to "hack into" anything.
Can you explain what kind of page that is? E.g. is it a form, or do you have data which needs to be displayed in a "table"? ;)
C++Builder, from CodeGear, also supports the __asm keyword.
This code looks like PHP3 (or maybe 4), which register_globals enabled. You don't want to run this code, and it will also not work on a semi up to date PHP installation (which is version 5).
The will indent the value, and make it on a new line  Name  Value
That depends on the stylesheet. Take a look at the link in my answer and see for yourself.
I'd argue the labels are the headers. There is even an argument to th to specify a horizontal arrangement IIRC
Like Espo said, definition lists can be styled in any way you want. You can easily override the default newline/indentation styling.
GetBaseException does the same as what seems to be happening before Application.ThreadException event is raised: it walks down the chain of exceptions to the innermost exception. (checked it in reflector)
Ok, once I got my test certificate generation infrastructure working again, I'll see if 2.0 RC2 is any better at it.
But it sort of isn't a table.  In ASP.NET webforms, I suppose it could be the difference between GridView and DetailsView.
Adding     <system.net>       <defaultProxy enabled="false" />     </system.net>  to the web.config did the trick for me.
OK, but a set of data with a single row of headers and a single row of data is semantically closer to a definition list than a table.
you can also run proxycfg -d at the command line to ensure that all winHTTP applications run without using a proxy on the computer.
Maybe in a future version of the platform the CLR will load all classes as sealed first and patch them if it loads derived types later.
I use this a lot.  clone() is a great example.  It's supposed to return Object, which means you'd have to say e.g. (List)list.clone().  However if you declare as List clone(){...}, then the cast is unnecessary.
All .NET applications are multithreaded - there's at least the finalizer thread running along side your main thread.
You can have the applications post stuff in each other's message loops. There are probably better ways for inter process communication though. Try searching SO for IPC..
you might want to re-tag this so that "bestpractice" changes to the more commonly used "best-practices"
The first statement in the function is giving the function a default return value. The rest of the function is one case statement and some calls to other functions from the case points.
I know, there's also a similar bug report about too many local variables and parameters combined causes this, but this function is really simple.  Anyway, Delphi is buggy. What else is new :)
You may want to retag this to use sql2005 which seems to be more common than sqlserver2005 and sysadmin which is more common than system-administration
Good points.  I imagine that a lot of existing websites may not be able to easily re-structure their content placement.
It is the edge cases that get us into problems, though.  Knowing your production server's behavior is important once one goes beyond a certain level.
I agree with this. Have a method that determine the translation between the source data and the "rotated" data.
Bravo! This is a very nice solution and I don't know why it isn't the accepted answer.
I guess you meant you've adapted from the book "xUnit Test Patterns" by Gerard Meszaros. http://xunitpatterns.com
Good answer. But it isn't that bad if you don't unit test for everything in a delivery. Sure it's preferable, but there needs to be a balance and pragmatism. Re: getting your colleagues on board; sometimes you just need to do it to demonstrate value and as a reference point.
If you misspell the variable name, you've introduced a bug. Period. Personally, i never use with for stuff like this, but it is somewhat of a "hidden feature" so...
Sure, it has a plug-in architecture. But how many plug-ins does it have right now? And how many does Firefox have right now that are happily used by tens of thousands of people? That's my point.  Not holding my breath for that OS X version anytime soon.
I agree. However, in the long run, you need to be able to rely on tests being there, i.e. able to assume that common pitfalls will be caught by them. Otherwise, the benefits are massively diminished.
It would be nice to have links.  If you get a chance, could you add them?
Absolutely.  So much of today's software development methodoology is an attempt to write good software with bad developers.
Shog, the objections aren't about misspelled variables, they're about looking at a block of code, and being able to say with certainty what any particular line in that block does. Because Javascript objects are so dynamic, you can't say with certainly what properties/members it has at any moment.
Good point. I'll revise my response to note this.
I agree. Being able to type www.php.net/function_name and getting a reference most of the time is great.
What error do you see?  If it's either a NoClassDefError or a ClassNotFoundException then it's probably a classpath issue.
@Rismo Not exclusive per se. By definition what Quarrelsome wrote here is exclusive to "Test First" methodology, which is part of TDD. TDD also takes refactoring into account. The most "smarty pants" definition I've read is that TDD = Test First + Refactor.
True - they do reduce bowlerplate code and I will also ad that they reduce what you need to test. Some might argue that you need to test manual get/set but not with auto properties since you can trust the framework.
We did investigate getting a kernel debugger working, and I _think_ we got as far as doing either the !sysptes or the !vm command.  If I remember correctly they numbers did match the performance counter (which was a bit of a disappointment), but I'm hazy on the details.  Thanks for answering.
no it was a 'run this one time to fix an sql injection attack' type of thing... now I have to convince the powers that be that we need server-side authentication. Javascript authentication is NOT authentication haha
The code sample is wrong here. It should be   public class MyClass {    public int Age {get; private set;} }  I agree with this answer. You can't access the private field and if you need to, then you shouldn't be using Automatic Properties in the first place.
Didn't you mean "Having seen the rep. points and views this other question attracted, I thought I'd ask almost exactly the same question to boost my own"? ;-)
You can't mock `static` or `private` methods with EasyMock.   Moving the body of the static initializer is as far of a refactoring we can do for now.
Not sure that's a GREAT answer, since an ENUM would usually make a lot more sense, although I'm not sure how widely supported that type is (outside of MySQL).
I love Groovy but unfortunately all our test code must be in JUnit.
`System.out.println("static initialized.");` is what the static initializer is doing in the first place. Why should we mock what it already is doing with the same thing?
like what for example?  It seems to me like the functions are all awkwardly named and positioned in the global namespace.  Plus I can't think of anything thats not just as easy in another language except for maybe $arr[] = $newvalue for adding values  - thats cool
This feels like more of a hack than the approach posed in the question.
This code includes methods. Is there a way to exclude methods? I only need the object's fields. Thanks
Sure, pessimist. :)  I'd considered making this a community question.  Also, after you get a certain number of points it's all diminishing returns.
Weird.  How else would they interpret document.writeln or document.getElementsbyTagName?
Fair enough - it doesn't look as if you 'need' the rep! I guess I just have a big issue with the C# one - doesn't exactly seem to me like the type of question for which this site was intended.
Yeah, maybe not, but I found the knowledge in the answers great.  I think you'd be hard pressed to expose an average C# programmer to all of it in one place if not for SO.  It'd take years of playing with it to come up with the same hard won list.
That works also, but be aware that it will only give you the attributes set on the instance, not on the class (like class Foo in your example)...
The code snippet needs some corrections.. there is no ToList() in IEnumerable and AddRange should take a ICollection<T> to be consistent... Since I had to steam-roll through this temp setback to my grand plans of meeting my weekly target, posting my code sample.. a bit shorter.
Most people consider this one of the worst parts of the language when they first see it (3 equals!?).  I think knowing about it is important  though because it forces you to commit to memory that JavaScript is dynamically typed.
While the debugging aspect certainly has merit, the phrase "rare circumstance" is an understatement. Optimizing compilers are smart enough these days that it's exceedingly rare that you would have to write in assembly to gain performance. Also, it's worse than OS-specific, it's _machine_ specific.
Before you do this, because careful in your assumption that everybody is going to want you to clear forms, because personally, I like that form data is available during back/forward. It took a long time for browsers to do this and I'd hate for it to disappear!
That is a good one. It is a really important difference from most C like languages.
Yes I agree - Crockford talks about in the "worst part" appendix. It is a shame they couldn't have just made "==" behave as expected.
So far you've been really assumptive and controlling.  I do not have a particular type of scenario in mind, nor do I think Agile *requires* TD. Did something about my question trigger an emotional response? I'm unsure why you are so persistent in criticizing, instead of letting it go?
Gishu, the ToList() method is a LINQ extension method available on IEnumerable.
I like this series of questions; I think the "digg" like system for the answers is better than the "+1"'ing you see in forums. Much easier to see what the community think is most important. I'm sure this is good link bait for google too!
Agreed.  It's a matter of how well supported the virtual machines are on various  architectures.
One error : class MockedInterface must expose publicly the counter field. Written as it is it's just a private field.
Cem, I think you missed my point. I'm trying to answer the concern "However this solution also comes with its own problems. You can't run DependentClassTest and ClassWithStaticInitTest on the same JVM since you actually want the static block to run for ClassWithStaticInitTest."
hwiechers, thanks for that - I had that edit, but when trying to fix the formating I must have hit paste again and deleted the wrong block of code. Doh!
Basically, you have two different Mock Objects to Mock ClassWithStaticInit one for use with your DependentClassTest and the other for use with ClassWithStaticInitTest.
Another way to do this is to use the special FETCH_HEAD head, which reflects the result of the previous fetch. So: "git fetch && git diff ...FETCH_HEAD".
There are three ways to make functions in javascript:  function sum(x, y, z){   return (x+y+z); } and  var sum = new Function("x", "y", "z", "return (x+y+z);"); are the other ways.
i saw this a while ago, wanted to link it up in a question, but couldn't find it
There are plenty of illegitimate reasons, too, which is why you're unlikely to see Apple add that in as a feature.
According to http://ch2.php.net/language.oop5.typehinting, "string" isn't supported for type hinting. "array" is supported from PHP 5.1 on, and specific object types are supported since 5.0.
Call me ignorant, but do you even need to test ASP.NET with mono?  Everything that would be .NET is server side, thus is doesn't matter which OS it's displayed on does it?
You make some very good points, and I was tempted to advise using Twisted in my answer.  The main advantage of my approach is that it doesn't require anything outside of the standard library.  For a real application I'd just use CherryPy behind Apache or something else that's not BaseHTTPServer.
Ethan, using Mono you can host ASP.net apps on Linux.
ActiveScaffold looks exactly like what I'm looking for.  Thanks.
Yeah, something like: myGridDataView.Columns.Add( new DataGridViewCheckBoxColumn());
EHaskins, I think what Ethan was getting at is that why bother making it cross platform for ASP.NET when you control the server... just run it on Windows... Fogbugz type applications would be an exception (with possibility to run on client's server)
Correct. By creating placeholders at design-time, or by drawing directly onto the PrintDocument at run-time
@Mauro: i wasn't talking about 4 column layout, i meant deep DIV nesting
There doesn't seem to be a WaitMessage equivalent in .NET, and using P/Invoke just for a message loop seems a bit involving. (not that it's hard, but it can't be ment that way..)  Also I don't have another solution for my other question (see link in this question), so why is it pointless? :p
The problem with that is it's self-fulfilling. If you don't have a hammer, nothing looks like a nail. There are a lot of developers working in assembly every day, and they probably like the fact that people think this is very unusual, because it means their skills are rare and they make more money.
So, jcarrascal, you are better off wrapping the above code in a function like props(), then you can call either props(f) or props(Foo). Notice that you are almost always better off writing a function, rather than writing 'inline' code.
Excellent points. Unit tests can be very useful but it's very important to avoid falling into the trap of having complex, interdependent unit tests which create a huge tax for any attempts to change the system.
Yea for the third alternative I mention that since I'm importing the class there isn't a parent to child relationship, Thanks!
Why would adding complex logic to your class affect whether or not you used automatic properties within that class?
Well, there the problem is the static block is run only once per JVM. So you can either have the original static block run or your mock one. The `ClassWithStaticInit` depends on the fact that it has a static block. So for `ClassWithStaticInitTest you shouldn't really be mocking `ClassWithStaticInit`
why are you against having an rc file?
I want to be able to modify it at runtime.
What is the difference in this case of accessing the private vs the public accessor?  I think it is best practice to access the public accessor even from the logic in the declaring class. If you ever add some logic to the accessor you do not want to have to change all your code.
You would be surprised how often developers don't update their javadocs when they change the semantics of a method... I have seen it A LOT.  That said, frameworks and the language itself are usually good about it.
The new annotations: awesome if they come about, but you still need to document what the semantics of a null value are with say @Nullable. I find it best to be very explicit what passing null will actually do, and @Nullable only indicates that it's allowed, not what it does.
Pardon me, but if you think pinvoke is too involving you should think again about trying to write custom message loop. Regarding your other question, if you for some obscure reason want to handle exceptions in _unhandled_ exception event, be prepared for some hacks.
Actually, you may benefit by writing such a class, particularly if your functions need to maintain any additional state/data while reading or writing the file.
@Mike Stone agreed, seems the documentation is mandatory after all... As for the javadoc, I concur: in fact, in my 200 developpers project, the javadoc for public api is rarely documented! (sigh!)
well, the C# is ISO standardized, so the idea was to have something cross-platform. microsoft didn't want to develop implementations for other platforms, but it's left to other parties as the language is a standard.  the .Net framework is a more complicated story, though.
comma creates tuple, therefore expression: `q, r` *is* a tuple.
Thanks for the link on the edit control that stackoverflow uses. Pretify looks nice, but wasn't quite what I meant by live highlighting. TinyMCE and a few other WYSIWYG editors show what your page should look like while you're typing in the textarea...I'm looking for one that does the same for code.
I don't think it is good and safe to think that, because it's wrong :-p  I'd be inclined to remove point 2 from an otherwise good answer.
The concept of functions-as-data definitely wins big points in my book.
His examples weren't what I was looking for, but he had two links at the bottom of the page that I found helpful. Thanks.
Amen - if I saw the "with" statement in any JS I found, I would eliminate it and question the developer that wrote it to make sure he knew why it was not a Good Thing to use it..."hidden feature?" More like "abhorrent feature."
It's a shame that so many people think Crockford is all-knowing. Granted, the guy is right on the mark with most of his criticisms, but I stop short of giving his stuff a blanket endorsement like so many devs do...
Lucene is not for MSSQL either, you can 2 choices: index documents prior passing it to DB or let indexing engine go through DB itself. Sphinx can't crawl MSSQL automatically as far as I know, but it has best indexing performance.
0xFF is signed, not unsigned. 0xFFU is the unsigned version. Only *p needs to be promoted.
The main title is misleading, it would be good if someone could edit to reflect the fact that IainMH was talking about the layout of form fields.
operator[] returning a int pointer? Maybe this is what you meant:      int* operator[](size_t y) { return &ary[y*width]; }  Then you could write:      my2DArray[y][x]  Although better practice would be to use operator():      int& operator[](int x, int y) { return ary[y*width+x]; }
Can you say "premature optimisation"? Why not leave those kind of fancy tricks up to the compiler?
Good point , however I don't really agree that overloading the function call operator is necessarily better practice. If you are wrapping an array, you should make it look like an array.
Perhaps stopping keystrokes... is not the best title. Perhaps "How do I make a web application respond just as quickly as a desktop application?". Just a suggestion.
The C++ FAQ has some justifications for using operator(). http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/operator-overloading.html#faq-13.11
the single dim array will save little or no space over the multi dim version
Sure, but how does that use a higher level of abstraction?
if you cast the newed array to a "pointer to array of 800 ints" (int[800] *buff; // ??) you can avoid the [x*w+y] kludge
Is that FAQ meant to be a set of reasons for why you shouldn't use array syntax, or why the C++ standard sucks? I found it unconvincing either way.
The single dim array may or may not save space, the point is that it should be a lot faster to make only one large allocation.
What does "default SVN plugin in Eclipse Ganymede platform" mean? Ganymede means Eclipse release 3.4. Does subclipse only work on 3.3 and earlier?
There is a bug in this code, it will fail when width and height are not equal. array[x*xwidth + y] should be array[y*xwidth + x].
They will expand to fit the content regardless.  But if you want to ensure that the height is no more than necessary for the contents, set the height of the header and footer to 0%.  You can still apply padding to ensure that they don't look "crunched."
as pointed out by Tom Hawtin in the 'winning' answer, one cannot instance List<String> as it is only an interface.
eh, I like the manual and all but it would be nicer if everything was not just global.  Not to mention some of the function names are so arbitrary its sometimes hard to find what you want.
That's useful to know as I do call Java code from native code so it'll add to the points where I can handle unexpected exceptions/crashes.  It's looking like I'm going to have to scatter the code with a few checks for crashes using code like this.
Are 2 extra adds and 3 shifts really faster than just doing a multiply? Wouldn't the compiler notice a multiply by a const and do this itself if it really were quicker? Also, if you change the const, you have to remember to rewrite the shift/add code.
I went for ReadDirectoryChangesW in the end and had fun working out how to convert the buffer returned into a form I could pass back to my Java code, but it definitely does what I want.
Nice! I had to take a triple take on this until I realized that you're defining a property on the function itself.  I had to run alert(someFunction.someStaticVariable); for it to sink in.
The code project code demonstrates wonderfully how to get this information. I needed to use StrRetToStr(...) to get the returned value in a form that JNI could use in Java, but that was easy enough.
I might have misunderstood; but is their something in particular that you think he's off the mark on?
JNA did look like a nice way of doing what I wanted, but sadly I had to start creating new window classes and call back functions for it, which didn't seem possible so I had to fall back to using JNI.
CPP tasks worked great for what I needed thanks. I ended up needing to do some cross compilation but the ability to specify which class to use for the back-end  for cpptasks solved that.
I always find that a problem on stackoverflow. It's the problem of choice when you really want to say that both are good.  I guess if both are equally useful then they'll be voted up by similar numbers so stay near the top. Let the people decide :)
You want to be careful with this, depending on what your NSIS installer is for. You might find that you accidentally include a DLL in your installer which you don't have a license to redistribute.
If you ever need to explictly dereference a reference then %{$row} will work, which can be useful sometimes to ensure you're passing the right thing to the right sort of thing.
When I run the original code it works up to the over flow point and then prints for every count.
Ah the wonders of getting a NullPointerException rather than a -429321313 Error code dialog. Makes me proud to be a developer :)
Also, in pretty much every case where Java can't do a native operation in a cross-platform manner, the same will be true for .NET
I really should have thought this answer out better - a further benefit of using a custom template file is the ability to force other nodes to use the template via the template_preprocess_page function in template.php.
No, Subclipse keeps working in later versions.  For earlier versions, it's your only choice.
MemProfiler has save our team when we had a memory leak.  I tried other tools, but no other tool gave the same detail.
cool I never knew that about the magic number in the exception code.
The code you provided is VB syntax, not VBScript. The "As" keyword, and "WithEvents" are not available in VBScript.
I don't suppose you could add a fully working mxml example file that does this?  I'm having trouble getting my head fully around it...
I don't agree with this at all.  My company has been using VSS for almost 10 years and there would be tons of history missing if we just "started fresh."  I do agree that VSS is garbage but it's better than nothing and just throwing out years of file history is a big mistake.
Vinko, an example is tempfile.mkstemp() from the standard library, which returns a tuple containing a file handle and an absolute path.  JFS, yes, you're right.
Not everyone wants to run their app on Windows, for whatever reason.
One problem with Mono lagging behind the MS implementation is when you have major API changes (.NET 3.5 with W?F, for example).  By the time you get there in Mono, you're so far behind the rest of the world, you may be less competitive (not always the case, but one of the risks of being behind).
Nice point. I'll check that cost when I get back to work this week. The main pro I find here is that it is easier to save debug info in the file without having it on screen. Also, serial I/O is the main bottleneck in my project.
Agreed, but... their documentation is unparalleled.
example assumes you have short tags enabled
I definitely agree, I'd love to see this as a priority for PHP 6. Since they are now releasing namespace support in the forthcoming 5.3 release, I'm hoping the next logical step is to start moving their standard library functions to its own namespace/class heirarchy.
SPL is definitely a step in the right direction. I just think it's extremely messy having so much core functionality in the global namespace. It seems ridiculous to me that I have to worry about naming collisions with what is built-in to the language.
If you write your own code in an OO way, there's rarely any worry.  Since the chances of conflicting with anything in the core is almost zero.   And even if you do, it'll fail.   I completely get where you're coming from though.  PHP just doesn't have that flavor. Python might be a better choice.
They do allow for notifications in reverse, it just isn't immediately obvious since the connections need to already be made, or be made at regular intervals to check for the notifications.
Not bad, but what if your site has secure pages i.e. https:// What if your domain is not hosted on port 80?
Yeah I have :/  Viewing the same page as a jsp result (rather than a tile result) responds in a UTF-8 encoded page.
Cem,   But you could write junit (even junit4) tests in groovy. ;-)  Kind Regards
@Ben Collins: I don't really believe that is a valid argument. I would always recommend to a developer to stay up to date with the newest frameworks, but I would never recommend they start using those new frameworks in production code without some latency. Frameworks have their problems after all...
@mike Stone: When trying to stay competitive, you will sometimes find clients who do not have or do not wish to have MS products in their server racks. I cannot say I agree, but I can certainly respect their wishes. Therefore, being able to run my apps on Linux is a large benefit.
@Soeren: I have already read that article, and understand it's contents. My question was in relation to objects instantiated on an IB xib, which it doesn't cover.  Eg: I never actually create or allocate the label, the IB magic does all that. So what I need to know is simple:do I need to release it?
yeah, but the only problem with Markdown is that it explicitly *allows* HTML markup alongside Markdown.. which makes it fairly tough
We may disagree on the use of Mocks, but this was a very nice writeup of  unit testing best practices.
Decimals are not exact either, unless they are infinite precision.
CSS can handle multi column layouts very well. You people assume that multi columns means "a single article, split up into multiple columns" (just like your daily newspaper), but that's not it. The standard page design is, nav|content|etc - that's multiple columns as well and CSS can handle that.
What kind of files do you plan to put in it?
I need it to be a dynamic link so that as people update the article it is updated on my page.
I can't get the desired results with this table approach. The table seems to ignore the overall set height and sets it according to row heights, which is wrong (at least in IE). Also, I don't know how to make the content scrollable when too high.
Nope, my problem is I have exactly that in place, but the Exception passed in the ThreadExceptionEventArgs is _already_ the innermost exception, ie. the result of GetBaseException()...  IOW, the exception passed in ThreadExceptionEventArgs ALWAYS has a null InnerException property..
yeah I was able to make it work for that. Its a bit odd, with a blocking read() - but at least there is zero latency (rather, no polling !).
In my experience decent highlevel exception handling is always one big hack and I want to get it done as well as possible. Getting just the innermost exception in debug/log output is NOT an option, and copy pasting try catch blocks in all event handlers isn't either...
When the object is not a DateTime, don't use Parse, rather use ParseExact and specify the expected date and time format, to avoid being dependent on current user culture settings. See my answer on this question.
With regards to WaitMessage, I just ain't gonna do P/Invoke until Thread.Sleep actually gives some serious trouble...  http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=254151
Let's avoid writing defensive code. The developer should know what type / format to expect and **fail** (eg. throw an exception) when the value supplied is with a different format or type.  TryParse should be used **only** on user supplied input.
But that IS a single purpose... You can have single purpose and multiple return values
Not sure why someone bumped you down, but it looks like you are correct.
Wrt handling exceptions in the Application.ThreadException event (which isn't really a unhandled exception event in the win32 notion, AFAIK): that's actually what I want to prevent. But it requires me to roll my own messageloop, or sprinkle try catch blocks throughout the code...
Your START_PROFILE macro should start with the open curly brace and not have parens (otherwise it's a function declaration and not a variable "{ cProfile Profile;" Also the ctor and dtor in cProfile should be public.
me neither. Maybe the actual code snippet is convincing enough ;)
Yes, but CSS can't handle what people assume well. CSS shortsightedness is always explained away by blaming the developer. CSS is always nicer when it works, but I don't like advocates blaming the developer for trying to do something that users want.
Loading in another session is not an option: the real problem is more involved but the short answer is that we can't.
I've added an example HTML document that shows the border showing even on blank cells.  Tested in IE7, fx3 and the latest safari. The main side-effect of border-collapse is you can't have double borders that look decent.  Also, missing cells can't be styled no matter how hard you try
I think that creating a buffer row pointers lookup table would be faster anyway. You can create it in the class constructor based on buffer size.
CruiseControl.NET has some nice integration with Altassian JIRA, however.
You should probably specify which environment you had in mind. The only environment I know that even supports JavaScript <-> Sqlite interaction is Adobe AIR.
I don't mean to be unhelpful, but no. I think that the code I've shown is what you need to solve the problem. The rest is just plumbing.
The problem with this approach is that although IDENTITY is standard SQL, it's not available in all databases. Also, SELECT TOP is neither standard SQL, nor widely implemented. Apart from that, the copying of data may be a much slower operation compared to the methods which don't use a temp table.
How would I add a breakpoint to the constructor of SqlConnection that takes a String?  I tried: System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.ctor(string) System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection.ctor(string connectionString) ... and the same with SqlConnection instead of ctor.
Well. When you have a couple of hundred parties involved, and you need to set up a lot of different format mappings and types of transfer, you really want to use a system like BizTalk.
That's great, but it's desktop based. I'm asking for web based.
Perhaps a view might be applied rather than creating a temp table? Can you create a view where one of the columns is an identity column?
I'll bump this one up as an answer then because I find the "A TRIP" acronym useful.
But you are even here using engine dependent SQL!
Vinko Vrsalovic , I think I wrote it clear: "t's obviously bad, so no need to comment on it."
Yes it is risky to use them, these hidden keywords, were introduced before generics to make interop,P/Invoke faster, because these features let you avoid boxing/unboxing value types.
Beware using ActiveScaffold, the views are immensely complex, and there's problems with supporting the latest rails.
But I'd also like to add that these keywords are used in BCL sources, so until MS rewrites the BCL (which won't happen till next version .Net CLR), they are rather safe use, if you're willing to do some rewriting posibly to run on CLR past 2.x.
My final stab-in-the-dark, given the original behaviour and your replacement solution, is that your x variable / ms_timer() function is / returns an int larger than 16 bits, which causes an unintended type promotion when calculating the time difference.
That doesn't work because I need the -print to work.  If grep returns a success, then find prints the file name, otherwise it doesn't.
Biri, you still should make sure these lines are in your web.config.
Strange, but it worked. Every sample says: Add Login.aspx to your project/website.
Actually they are of course, except that I have only one web.config and it contains <deny users="?"> in the auth section.
It will be a transactional DB.  Any specific MySQL features I should be expecting to hear about?
Probably calculate the age of the universe or time left till doomsday... :P
I do not like this hack, see my answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/62013/problem-with-login-control-of-aspnet#62092
Interesting question...I'm going to be doing this myself in the coming weeks too.  Could you elaborate on the problems you are having with the FLV approach?  I would have thought it would work OK...
I don't use SSL. It is only a test project to check some things.
Agreed, it's no use to me but it's a really good question nonetheless :)
Mono is a good implementation though and DotGNU (for Mac too)
You should be aware that there is a certain degree of controversy surrounding Blueprint:  http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2007/nov/17/whats-not-love-about-css-frameworks/  http://jeffcroft.com/blog/2007/nov/18/follow-up-css-frameworks/  Just something to be aware of. :)
