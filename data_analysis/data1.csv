1049,"     Well yes I do. There were many who lived under Nazi occupation who strongly supported Joe Stalin. In Occupied Holland for example it was the communists who organised the hiding and escape of Jews.  In Britain in 1941 ""Uncle Joe"" would have come third in a popularity contest behind Churchill and King George VI and ahead of Roosevelt, who said nice things but hadn't actually provided any troops yet. And of course there were millions of decent men and women in the 1920s and 30s who looked to communism as a better way than the economic system they had to live under. So a blanket kneejerk condemnation is simplistic.     Nice try Grant, but that was not the question asked. So -  ""You will readily denounce Pinochet, Somoza the Shah of Iran - to name but three?

1136,"     Grant,  The point is I haven't had an answer. You declined to talk about the Spanish civil war when I hadn't even asked you to. I asked you to comment on the US entering into a military alliance with fascist Spain in the early 50s.   In fact in summarising our debate over Mc Carthyism it is clear that your argument is hypocritical and full of holes.   You've made a statement along the lines of, 'we should be vigilant against fascism and communism'. Well the US govt. certainly wasn't. I've already pointed that the the US admin. worked with fascists in Greece, Italy and Spain(as well as a host of murderous dictatorial regimes across the globe). Yet you build an argument around the need to protect 'freedom'. This is utterly hypocritical.   The US , during the Mc Carthy period was hounding people they believed were communists, or used to be, or knew somebody who was, or thought they knew somebody or was etc etc. all in the name of 'freedom'.  But who were the kind of people being hounded? I would never join the CP but am more than aware of how many of their members have rallied to progressiove causes. In Britain who was it who stood in the front line when the British Union of Fascists tried to drive out the Jews? The CP. And who was it who fought against and suffered under the Nazis in Germany?  And what would Nelson Mandela say? Imprisoned for 27 years, who was it in the front line against the vile Apartheid regime? The CP. Whilst the US on the other hand were happy to work with the regime in  the military conflict in Angola.  The truth is Mc Carthyism has nothing to do with preventing mass murder by Stalinism and everything to do with denying freedom in the US itself. You say you are for trade union freedom but Mc Carthyism amounted to hounding union officials out of jobs and sacking people for not signing 'loyalty oaths'. The kind of unionism you favour is compliant unionism , the tame variety that does fight for members interests.   This is what Mc Carthyism was all about. Talking about freedom whilst dealing with fascists. Hounding people who the most likely to rally for freedom of black people in the USA and South Africa.    A final point about Islam. Again you spout hypocrisy on this issue. For years the US has used Saudi Arabia as a client state in its dealings in the oil rich Middle East. Yet this alliance has spawned the likes of Bin Laden , the irony is presumably lost on you.

1148,"&lt;&lt;  When you talk about the Jews having been 'kicked out' of Israel, are you talking about ancient history? Because it is mad! Before the Jews were there, somebody else was there and so on, back into the mists of time.&gt;&gt;  These people who were there before the Jews , who were they ? ,  where are they now ?.And what evidence do can you adduce  to support  the claims of whosoever you bring forward in support of your  argument ?.  &lt;&lt; Once again, do you have the same theories about every piece of land? Who is the true owner of England; Saxon? Dane? Celt? (This is very bad news for most of the people who think they are citizens of a country like the USA)  &gt;&gt;  What are my 'theories about every piece of land ' ?. I am talking about People.  People have connections with with geographic regions.    &lt;&lt; I thought you were saying that as long as you could keep Palestinians off their land until the first generation were all dead then that would make their dispossession acceptable. I do not think that is the right way to treat anyone; Armenian, Jew or Palestinian.&gt;&gt;  It would help if you  read what I actually wrote and then consequent upon digestion thereof  you responded with your opinion. I pointed out that MOST  'Palestinians'  who were alive in 1947 are now no longer alive. Even if they were born in 1947 they would now be 61. The vast majority of the Palestinians were born post 1947. This is a simple fact. So now , on what basis do you advance the notion that they have the right to go and live in the State of  Israel ?. Pay close attention to the last  three words. State of Israel. Nine Syllables.Concatenate . Aspirate.Appreciate.   &lt;&lt; First of all nowhere did I say that if you can displace 'a population' for long enough then it does not matter , and I challenge you to either point where i said as much or withdrw that remark.. &gt;&gt;  You then go on to quote  two paragraphs from my previous post that do not in any way substantiate or even speak to the idea that 'it does not matter'. In fact if you go back and read my posts you will  find that I  am sympathetic to  Palestinian aspirations towards Statehood.  &lt;&lt; I do not know why I am finding it so hard to explain that I find all this talk of who is or isn't a 'people' both absurd and sinister. We should treat people as individuals - when considering the right way to treat a fellow British person is I do not first need to find out if they are a Jew! Similarly, states have a duty to displaced persons; their 'people' is irrelevant. &gt;&gt;  And I on the other hand am quite astonished at your 'difficulty'.It seem to me that you are taking great pains to deny the existence of the fundamental anthropological imperative to form cultures. Yes of course we should and  do treat people as individuals.But  your next statement is at once  problematic yet informative. And belies a smidgeon of  arrogance on your part. You have a world view.It is your world view.If you do NOT consider the individual  as he has SELF DEFINED himself  you have abrogated to ourself the right to impose a world view upon him because without consideration to the way he has self defined himself all mutual interaction has to be based upon your world view. I love pork crackling. They are cheap  and the after taste hangs around for longer than a packet of crisps .I always have some on me.I  never offer them to my son's Somali team-mate. And condiderate Englishmen don't indulge in conversations centred around the derring-do of British bomber pilots in front of Germans. I would hope that you transact with other people with a bit more sensitivity.         &lt;&lt; So your difference with the BNP is that they are interested in 'race' and you are interested in something called 'self-identity' &gt;&gt;  I am not 'interested' in self identity. It exists.It is.    &lt;&lt;  Actually, the mainstream BNP tend to use your approach these days. They deny their dislike of immigrants is about racism - it is all about 'shared values' and 'Britishness'. &gt;&gt;  The BNP can use whatever disengenous 'approach' they like to camouflage the fact that their ideals are racist. However 'shared values' and 'Britishness' are quite correctly mainstream concepts and are incorporated into both Labour and  Conservative party policies.    &lt;&lt; No, it's not up to them. It is up to all of us to fight against that sort of behaviour.&gt;.  Again , you arrogant slip is showing. On what basis do you abrogate to yourself the right to decide how others view themselves , their history , their heritage , their norms and  who others wish or do not wish to associate with. I am quite franjly astonished at your arrogance. Would you then take issue with Nelson Mandela  then when he offered Afrikaaners the option of constitutionally negotiating for an Afrikaaner homeland. ?   &lt;&lt; You are free to associate for your mutual benefit but only up to the point where it infringes on the rights of other groups to equal treatment.

You ask “WHY do you think they want to control Iraqi oil?” Well, the answer is that oil is very useful to America. Why is it very useful to America? Read this article: <a href=""http://www.energybulletin.net/4287.html"">www.energybulletin.n...</a>.   In a previous post, you asked “please explain when you think we'll start balancing the scales against those billions already spent and the billions more to come.” I pointed out that you were assuming I thought America would “balance the scales” at all. Now you claim not to have made this assumption, but I'm afraid you did. It’s there in black and white. How am I supposed to answer a question based on a false assumption? I don’t know whether the American investment in Iraq will bear dividends. I don’t think the Americans do, either.  “If [the motive is] money…at least explain why you think the US government would think it would be profitable.”  I’ve had to cut out large chunks of your post to find this question, but I think it’s what you’re getting at. Why did the US think it would be profitable? Well, in my opinion they had a much shorter war in mind. They wanted to fight a quick war with a small army, gain control of Iraq, install military bases and a compliant “puppet government,” then leave.   You’ll notice that I am not replying any more on the Canada question. This is because I don’t think it merits any further response.

Europe's R&amp;D was falling behind the Soviets, never mind the Americans and Europe's economies were stagnant. Back in the 1950's the Deutschmark was mickey mouse money and the French franc traded at 1000's to the dollar. And the British pound was part way through a long decline.     No, but a Europe of mutually suspicious nations that can be played off against each other might suit. Not so suspicious that another war was a possibility but certainly the WSJ would approve of a Europe where the various nations competed in lowering taxes and regulations on business. Business always likes governments to engage in a race to the bottom on workers rights, environmental protection and corporate taxation.  (If you think states should race to the bottom like that then maybe you should do the decent thing and tell us why you think workers should have little or no job security, why polluters should get away scot free and why the burden of taxation should fall disproportionately on the middle incomes and lower)",NEGATIVE,0.9997474551200867

Tenet reveals the Bush administration had already concluded Iraq was going to face consequences before the estimate was finished in 2002.

I remember thinking to myself as I'm about to go brief the president, 'What the hell is he talking about?""'   He also writes ""There was never a serious debate that I know of within the administration about the imminence of the Iraqi threat.”  Tenet claims Dick Cheney wanted to ""handpick"" Iraq's leaders after Saddam’s fall and limit the country’s involvement. This was despite proclaiming publicly that establishing a democratic government was among the reasons for the invasion.   Cheney and Pentagon officials pushed for a ruling coalition that included Ahmed Chalabi, Kurdish leaders and exiled Hussein opponents   ""Rather than risking an open-ended political process that Americans could influence but not control, they wanted to be able to limit the Iraqis' power and handpick those Iraqis who would participate.

Your point does not follow that if Tesco is very profitable then it must be poor value.  Your position in general illustrates why regulators should stay out of market decisions: perception of value is the result of a myriad of factors given varying weight by a myriad of individuals.  I, for instance, am well aware that the Tesco's fruit &amp; veg aisle represents mediocre value and is none too pleasant to boot.  However, my time is valuable, and I don't always get the opportunity to go to my favourite fruit and veg store.  I feel guilty about this (nothing I can't handle) and do it anyway.  Others may like the fact that they are shopping at a big trusted name.  Others may like the fact that what they want is always in stock.  Or that there is a relatively hasslefree returns section.

Of course it didn't get published (I hate ""Fully Moderated"" - a.k.a. HYS censorship mechanism).  But with only 500 characters there's plenty of stuff that didn't get expounded on.  Kim Jong Il's frustration is that he can't use his massive army without incurring a US military response.  But the bomb implies massive US casualties up front - I doubt if the US Congress would have backed the invasion of Iraq if they'd've known it meant 3,000 dead.  It's only that the casualties have been incurred over a few years that has numbed their power to shock the US population.

1806," I am an unabashed zionist and proud supporter of Israel. I have in the past had two significant events in my life where I interacted with muslims and arabs. In one I worked for a year with Feisal eighteen inches to my right and Muhammad eighteen inches to my left. Both were of Indian extraction, one being Pakistani and the other Indian. The other experience was where I worked for six months in a small company that was entirely staffed by lebanese, both christian and muslim. The two owners with whom I worked closely everyday were a lebanese christian and a muslim syrian.  With just about all of these people I participated in completely engaging but civil debate. Muhammad and I had a lot of fun as he was a huge cricket fan and taught me the ins and outs, but he was apolitical. Feisal was an observant muslim of a liberal sect. We traded a lot of details about life in a mosque in comparison to life in a synagogue. He was a bona fide genius I think, and he also opened my eyes to issues vis-à-vis the muslim world and the U.S.A. The syrian was a brilliant man extremely well versed in contemporary history. He had me really working hard and I had to re-examine a lot of previously conceived notions I had.  By the way, all without exception were western educated; not necessarily in western institutions but rather in the western tradition.  I like to think I am an intellectually honest person. I invite you to travel the link to my posts to examine my arguments.  This has been my experience:   I have met here some rabid pro-zionists whose posts I personally find embarrassing. The rabid anti-zionists seem to be an order more vitriolic. I can sense the blind hatred. Also, they are easily frustrated with the simplest critical thinking. There really is no debate here at all. It is all quips based on self-enforcing and cross-referenced hate propaganda. To even question its veracity brings immediate indirect fire as opposed to an actual response.  Based on my own reading and research there is certainly a palestinian narrative of merit. To say otherwise, in my opinion, is nonsensical. I have participated in excellent debate and exchange of information here on these boards. A fair number of times I have been challenged by posters' comments that required me to stop and re-examine my thinking. Always these have been alleged facts that I was not previously aware of and I spent the time researching the issue and verifying the facts. A Case on point is my discussion with Ed regarding water usage in Israel/P-Territories.  Without exception every post that I felt had merit and that I fact-checked did not pan out. Some citations were to reputable pro-Palestinian sources that  I had to delve a lot deeper into the primary source data (UN reports and the like). A lot was just unsubstantiated myth mongering devoid of any sources at all. Some others were simply foolish. I remember one citation that was to a headline to the effect of ""Israel - [some atrocity]"". I tried clicking the headline but there was no link, no links anywhere on the page for that matter. It was just a list of made up headlines. I very strongly notice that all of the pro-palestinian myth mongering is cross-referenced. Each ""argument"" refers to other self-documenting resources that refer back in a web of cross-references.  Then, of course, there is Pallywood and fauxtography, the arab/muslim art of invented videos and photographs.  Finally, there are out-and-out lies that are apparent on their face, ranting really.  I did my own research into the apparently endless list of Israeli atrocities. I found several clear acts of improper military behaviour, but only a few.  I found some of unacceptable civilian behaviour towards palestinians. Then there is the government based acts, an example of which is uprooting olive orchards. Finally, there are actual war crime type atrocities, for example, the 800-900 arab deaths in this category during the 1948 war as explained by the ""new"" historian Benny Morris.  Now, do I mean that palestinians are not killed--not at all. In my view, the vast majority of so-called atrocities, war crimes, genocide, ethnic cleansing, animal behaviour, etc. ad nauseam, is related to the palestinian insurrection (Intifadah) in the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank and the Israeli attempts to manage and quell the insurrection.  These actions fall into a few categories:  1. Clearing a designated military reserve of protestors 2. Quelling insurrection (rock throwing, etc.) 3. Immediate retaliation to armed attacks 4. Pro-active attacks by the IDF to degrade and destroy palestinian military capabilities 5. Ongoing border screening  In other words, I don't deny the suffering of individual palestinians. I both sympathize and empathize with the pain and suffering. The two peoples are at war. The IDF will make every effort to avert collateral damage, but civilians will get hit when a Qassam stockpile is hit. Palestinians have to wait hours at the border, but every parcel, truck, ambulance, and person must be physically checked for suicide vests and ordinance smuggling. Only about 5% of palestinian attackers get through. That means for every bombing in Tel-Aviv or Jerusalem, 19 others were thwarted or caught at the border. For better or worse, until a final settlement is reached, Israel is responsible for the populations in the territories and for order and security. Violent insurrection cannot be allowed lest anarchy take hold. As part of the occupation, certain areas are classified by military authorities. The justness of it or not is not my point. When a soldier with a rifle under orders to clear the area tells you to do so, one takes his life into his own hands to disobey. When Qassam rockets are fired into Israel, you can bet your grand-mother's pearls that a bigger rocket is coming back your way. For that matter, if a palestinian fires rockets next to a civilian home, he knows that the return fire may hit that home as well. He ought to take responsibility for his choice. What are eight year olds doing throwing stones at tanks intermixed with adults armed with assault rifles.  All of this is ongoing military operations between two peoples at war. They are not acts of genocide or ethnic cleansing or anything like that.  With some exceptions, I find most pro-palestinian posters fall into one single pattern: a two or three sentence post of unsubstantiated outrageous claims. When one calls them out for evidence, I have gotten the run-around as I described above, or just non-answers. I have been engaged in serious debate by pro-palestinian supporters on these boards in only a small minority of instances.  I find that this profound penchant for dishonest debate is not so much acts of actual dishonesty, rather it is part and parcel of the overriding arab social characteristic of face-saving, i.e. self-deception. That is, as far as I can tell, so long is face is saved publicly, all is well. Prime examples of this are astounding claims of military victory in the face of catastrophic losses and on the verge of military annihilation.

1896,"   I would agree with this but only up to a point and the article isn't clear about this:  Is it REALLY, as you say, ""muslim-only time""?  If so, I agree.  If, as the article MAY be implying, these times are accessible to women of any faith that wish to swim in these particular conditions, then I disagree with you that it's ""segregation by ethnicity"".  Does anyone actually know?  By the way, this just reminds me of a sad personal story:  Years ago my mother was on an Ulpan program rooming with a young Palestinian woman and they became close friends.  At that time my mother was a big swimmer and availed herself of the swimming pool on a daily basis for exercise and heat relief.  After a number of months, her friend asked if she could go with my Mom early one morning and have my Mom teach her how to swim.  They did this once and it resulted in verbal hostility from some Arab men who happened to witness it.  She wore a VERY conservative (by Western standards, of course) one piece swimsuit and was careful to remain fully covered up until the last possible moment when entering and exiting the pool.  A day later, the woman came to my Mom in tears because the word had gotten back to her family in the West Bank and they had phoned her threatening to remove her from the program if she did that again.  She went again -- this time even earlier to avoid being seen and even more careful with regard to modesty.  Her family made good on their threat and she was gone in a matter of days and my Mom was never able to contact her and to this day doesn't know whether she received any of her letters or not or what became of her.  I don't care what people wanna do with regard to modesty and dress, in theory:  But I do object to legal adults being denied the right to make their own decision on what they want to wear in places where it's acceptable for others to dress the same -- ie, if it's at a pool where swimsuits are accepted attire at that time.",NEGATIVE,0.9998065829277039

Hi Conny, Zabak, others  Lets not pretend that Rahman's paper settles the issue.  I think the current understanding is that sexual orientation does not fall neatly into discrete categories, but rather places a person on a continuum ranging from enitrely attracted to the same sex or entirely attracted to the opposite sex. Whatever genetic influence there is on sexual orientation then, it is not 'either or'.  Beyond that cultural factors do seem to push peoples orientation this way or that. Its worth noting that absolute sexual categories did not/do not exist in some cultures. (Ancient Greece)  It is a little smililar to whether people are left/right handed oddly enough. It is estimated that hereditary factors account for just 32 percent of variability in handedness, but that doesnt account for 90% of people being right handed. A cultural bias towards right handedness accounts for that more effectively.  People can and do change their sexual orientation in the course of their lives. 'Gay' people go 'straight', 'straight' people go 'gay'.  the importance of cultural factors in determining sexual orientation should be acknowleged. Self actualisation is an important factor in personal happiness (and therefore, social cohesion). People must not be brought up to think that they are (or must be) exactly one way or another.  Here is a decent paper on it:  <a href=""http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15176896"">cat.inist.fr/?aModel...</a>  Note that my concern is that people should be able to freely discover their position on a continuum rather than to ""cure"" a natural/social orientation.

You attempt to dismiss any and all disagreement with your representation by pre-empting a few potential counterpoints and denoting them ""go[ing] round in escalating circles"", thereby showing no willingness whatsoever to hear differing viewpoints as you prematurely belittle them with your ""again if you wish"".  But that's PRECISELY what you're doing...  going round in circles!  Or at least that's how it appears to me in the absense of any apparent desire to go anywhere else...  Israel have said that they were within their rights under the ceasefire to engage in this action (and, according to the first link [IHT] that comes up from your google link, made this clear before the action):  Okay, this is something you think was a mistake and perhaps you and certainly others might disagree and believe it's more than just a bad PR decision but an actual violation...  But the main point you're missing is that the ceasefire violation by Hezbollah that Israel is claiming it was responding to has NOT been used by Israel as an excuse to abandon the ceasefire further than this action (or, presumably and reportedly, any others like it), from your beeb link:  ~ ~ ""Israel...insisted the truce held."" ~ ~  So where are you going?  Let's even say we agree that it was a PR mistake...  What happens next?  IS it an excuse for Hezbollah to announce a complete disconnection from the ceasefire?  IS it an excuse for the Lebanese government to renege?  Surely that gets it all back to where you suggest you don't want it -- going round in circles -- right?  Or is there something you haven't yet offered that would explain this apparent contradiction?  The BBC article you link to inadvertently touches on this further in parallel to this point and I think it's key to the conflict and, unfortunately, in much of the discussion going on it's being avoided:  ~ ~ ""The BBC's Nick Childs in Beirut correspondent says the UN's main concern is that the incident both highlights the urgent need for UN reinforcements and will put off potential troop contributors, because it projects an image of insecurity."" ~ ~  An ""image of insecurity""?  It didn't have that before?  So ""the UN's main concern"" is that any troops it might send will be aware of what's going on?  Is that a sneaked snippet of the planned 'rules of engagement'... know as little as possible about the conflict and make sure any and all troops are given a false sense of security just to ensure that they will, once again, be nothing more than sitting ducks in the line of fire?  And these parallels emanate from the same underlying point illustrated above and again as we see from the Lebanese Defense Minister (also from the beeb article):  ~ ~ ""He said any rocket fired from Lebanese territory would be considered collaboration with Israel to provide a pretext for it to strike. ... ...[he] said that if the UN failed to give ""clear answers"" in response to the raid he ""might be forced to ask the cabinet early next week to halt the army deployment in the south""."" ~ ~  So there we are:  That's the only result I can see of a discussion criticizing Israel for this 'PR disaster'...  Excuse for Hezbollah, excuse for Siniora and excuse for the UN.  Of course it warrants addressing but it's your purpose that will define how it's addressed and your address which will expose your purpose and, at the moment, it appears to be a desire to go round in circles and add your weight to the 'PR disaster'.",NEGATIVE,0.9985985159873962

Nazi Germany occupied most of Europe and the Europeans never started to kill each other.  Then the Russians occupied Eastern Europe and the allies Western Europe after the war and the civilians didn’t start to kill each other after three days, three years etc.  India was occupied by the British for years and years and the Indians didn’t suddenly turn on their neighbors and start killing them.

2027,"Hi Speed!  Sorry for not coming back to your comments earlier, my day got busy…  “I have mixed feelings about it Vina.” Yes. So do I, which is why I posted the question. There are so many possibilities and different scenarios, that I think we can only point at the most general and usual cases. So I think that that is why the Harrison Ford case is  not applicable to most people. Certainly this is millionaire celebrity and given his financial status, as you said, he will not be confronted with the typical cases of not being able to pay babysitting for the not so pleasant tasks J, more time available for parenting, etc.   ”Perhaps in some ways even a better parent as they would have years more wisdom and life experience to pass along, be more mature themselves than say a very young parent might be.”  Yes that may be a positive thing, but also the bigger the generational gap the most difficult it may be to understand each other.   ”So, I think that a given persons financial stability, emmotional readiness, maturity level and frame of time to actually spend with the child - particularly during the early developemental years, plays more of a significant role in what sort of parent they will make than does their age.  ”Lets face it, its just like that Harry Chapin song ""Cats in the Cradle""” I love that song….  “ by the time most kids are in their late teens and beyond, they dont spend all that much time with their parents anyway.:” True. This is however more than not the rule of life, but by the time children pass the teenage stage, get into adulthood and most of all, as they become parents themselves, then they will start “respecting” their parents again and begin to understand in retrospect why their parents acted the way they did…so parents now become the best friends, allies and advisers.  This is the part that I see as downside when having children late in life…  Now in the case of this woman in the article, she had twins. Speed, I can tell you how I was super-handful with one! So even as a young person, I was exhausted all the time! And the second baby came less than 2 years after (I know the same was for you)…so how this woman, who naturally wont have all the energy of a person in her 20s or 30s, will be able to cope with newborn twins!!!? Or she may turn out to do better than all of us!",NEGATIVE,0.9989672899246216

I asked you to comment on the US entering into a military alliance with fascist Spain in the early 50s.   In fact in summarising our debate over Mc Carthyism it is clear that your argument is hypocritical and full of holes.   You've made a statement along the lines of, 'we should be vigilant against fascism and communism'. Well the US govt. certainly wasn't. I've already pointed that the the US admin. worked with fascists in Greece, Italy and Spain(as well as a host of murderous dictatorial regimes across the globe). Yet you build an argument around the need to protect 'freedom'. This is utterly hypocritical.   The US , during the Mc Carthy period was hounding people they believed were communists, or used to be, or knew somebody who was, or thought they knew somebody or was etc etc. all in the name of 'freedom'.  But who were the kind of people being hounded? I would never join the CP but am more than aware of how many of their members have rallied to progressiove causes. In Britain who was it who stood in the front line when the British Union of Fascists tried to drive out the Jews? The CP. And who was it who fought against and suffered under the Nazis in Germany?  And what would Nelson Mandela say? Imprisoned for 27 years, who was it in the front line against the vile Apartheid regime? The CP. Whilst the US on the other hand were happy to work with the regime in  the military conflict in Angola.  The truth is Mc Carthyism has nothing to do with preventing mass murder by Stalinism and everything to do with denying freedom in the US itself. You say you are for trade union freedom but Mc Carthyism amounted to hounding union officials out of jobs and sacking people for not signing 'loyalty oaths'. The kind of unionism you favour is compliant unionism , the tame variety that does fight for members interests.   This is what Mc Carthyism was all about. Talking about freedom whilst dealing with fascists. Hounding people who the most likely to rally for freedom of black people in the USA and South Africa.    A final point about Islam. Again you spout hypocrisy on this issue. For years the US has used Saudi Arabia as a client state in its dealings in the oil rich Middle East.

Before the Jews were there, somebody else was there and so on, back into the mists of time.&gt;&gt;  These people who were there before the Jews , who were they ? ,  where are they now ?.And what evidence do can you adduce  to support  the claims of whosoever you bring forward in support of your  argument ?.  &lt;&lt; Once again, do you have the same theories about every piece of land? Who is the true owner of England; Saxon? Dane? Celt? (This is very bad news for most of the people who think they are citizens of a country like the USA)  &gt;&gt;  What are my 'theories about every piece of land ' ?. I am talking about People.  People have connections with with geographic regions.    &lt;&lt; I thought you were saying that as long as you could keep Palestinians off their land until the first generation were all dead then that would make their dispossession acceptable. I do not think that is the right way to treat anyone; Armenian, Jew or Palestinian.&gt;&gt;  It would help if you  read what I actually wrote and then consequent upon digestion thereof  you responded with your opinion. I pointed out that MOST  'Palestinians'  who were alive in 1947 are now no longer alive. Even if they were born in 1947 they would now be 61. The vast majority of the Palestinians were born post 1947. This is a simple fact. So now , on what basis do you advance the notion that they have the right to go and live in the State of  Israel ?. Pay close attention to the last  three words. State of Israel. Nine Syllables.Concatenate . Aspirate.Appreciate.   &lt;&lt; First of all nowhere did I say that if you can displace 'a population' for long enough then it does not matter , and I challenge you to either point where i said as much or withdrw that remark.. &gt;&gt;  You then go on to quote  two paragraphs from my previous post that do not in any way substantiate or even speak to the idea that 'it does not matter'. In fact if you go back and read my posts you will  find that I  am sympathetic to  Palestinian aspirations towards Statehood.  &lt;&lt; I do not know why I am finding it so hard to explain that I find all this talk of who is or isn't a 'people' both absurd and sinister. We should treat people as individuals - when considering the right way to treat a fellow British person is I do not first need to find out if they are a Jew! Similarly, states have a duty to displaced persons; their 'people' is irrelevant. &gt;&gt;  And I on the other hand am quite astonished at your 'difficulty'.It seem to me that you are taking great pains to deny the existence of the fundamental anthropological imperative to form cultures. Yes of course we should and  do treat people as individuals.But  your next statement is at once  problematic yet informative. And belies a smidgeon of  arrogance on your part. You have a world view.It is your world view.If you do NOT consider the individual  as he has SELF DEFINED himself  you have abrogated to ourself the right to impose a world view upon him because without consideration to the way he has self defined himself all mutual interaction has to be based upon your world view. I love pork crackling. They are cheap  and the after taste hangs around for longer than a packet of crisps .I always have some on me.I  never offer them to my son's Somali team-mate. And condiderate Englishmen don't indulge in conversations centred around the derring-do of British bomber pilots in front of Germans. I would hope that you transact with other people with a bit more sensitivity.         &lt;&lt; So your difference with the BNP is that they are interested in 'race' and you are interested in something called 'self-identity' &gt;&gt;  I am not 'interested' in self identity. It exists.It is.    &lt;&lt;  Actually, the mainstream BNP tend to use your approach these days. They deny their dislike of immigrants is about racism - it is all about 'shared values' and 'Britishness'. &gt;&gt;  The BNP can use whatever disengenous 'approach' they like to camouflage the fact that their ideals are racist. However 'shared values' and 'Britishness' are quite correctly mainstream concepts and are incorporated into both Labour and  Conservative party policies.    &lt;&lt; No, it's not up to them. It is up to all of us to fight against that sort of behaviour.&gt;.  Again , you arrogant slip is showing. On what basis do you abrogate to yourself the right to decide how others view themselves , their history , their heritage , their norms and  who others wish or do not wish to associate with. I am quite franjly astonished at your arrogance.

UK posters often say that they find it incomprehendible that Americans re-elected Bush.    When US posters in-turn ask UK why Blair was re-elected, we are often told it was because of domestic issues and that voters felt Blair was very strong on internal British interests.  And here you are suggesting that Mr. Blair did not take British interests seriously.  Of course there is always going to be differing opinion.

This means that Iran's revolutionary guard would perform well in a war against the US.   If the US attacks Iran, then that will trigger a repeat of the Lebanon war, but now on a much larger scale.

Your point does not follow that if Tesco is very profitable then it must be poor value.  Your position in general illustrates why regulators should stay out of market decisions: perception of value is the result of a myriad of factors given varying weight by a myriad of individuals.

However, my time is valuable, and I don't always get the opportunity to go to my favourite fruit and veg store.  I feel guilty about this (nothing I can't handle) and do it anyway.  Others may like the fact that they are shopping at a big trusted name.  Others may like the fact that what they want is always in stock.  Or that there is a relatively hasslefree returns section.

It has been suggested, on numerous occasions, that our friends across the pond are taught from the ""How to Maintain National Pride Post-European Explore, Conquer and Exploit Period"" textbooks published by the official (and state funded) ""European Revisionist History Textbook Corporation.""    Amerindians in Mexico are still screaming to be heard.  They are usually found at the bottom of the Mexican social heirarchy.  Sixty percent of the population of Mexico is ""mestizo"" (mixed Amerindian and EUROPEAN SPANISH blood), 30% claim to be PREDOMINATELY Amerindian, 9% are white (where did they come from?) 1% other.  Mestizo, who have a great deal of EUROPEAN SPANISH pride, refer to the Mexican Amerindian derogatorily as ""indio.""  Mexicans who claim the white Euros ""stole"" their land in the southern part of the US, are also guilty of having ""white Euro"" ancestors who stole land from their own ancestors (comical really--I wonder how their internal ancestral mix are able to cohabitate?).  Historically, Spaniards born in Spain were the ruling class and highest on the social ladder... 2nd were Mexican-born Spaniards, 3rd were mestizo and last on the ladder were the ""indios"" and all others...  After Mexico won their independence from Spain (after 3 centuries of Spanish rule), the ""creole"" (Spaniards born in Mexico) became the ruling class and highest on the social ladder... which is where they remain today...   Furthermore, 95 - 98% of all Amerindians (indigenous peoples throughout the ""Americas"") were wiped out (European introduced diseases) during the European explore, conquer and exploit period--long before any European inhabitant of the ""new world"" started dreaming about independence from Europe.  By comparison, very few indigenous people lost their lives after the US gained independence from Britain.  We will take (and have taken) responsibility for our part.

Having the bomb serves as a deterrence against US military involvement should Kim Jong Il start to press his expansionist aims in the region.  This also explains why the North Korean government are so keen to promote news of the test.  A nuclear exchange remains unlikely but the probability of conventional conflict in the Korean peninsula has definitely increased.  Of course it didn't get published (I hate ""Fully Moderated"" - a.k.a. HYS censorship mechanism).  But with only 500 characters there's plenty of stuff that didn't get expounded on.  Kim Jong Il's frustration is that he can't use his massive army without incurring a US military response.  But the bomb implies massive US casualties up front - I doubt if the US Congress would have backed the invasion of Iraq if they'd've known it meant 3,000 dead.  It's only that the casualties have been incurred over a few years that has numbed their power to shock the US population.  Intelligence from post-1991 Iraq indicated that Saddam didn't think he was wrong to have invaded Kuwait, just that he should have waited to acquire the bomb first.

3847," I am an unabashed zionist and proud supporter of Israel. I have in the past had two significant events in my life where I interacted with muslims and arabs. In one I worked for a year with Feisal eighteen inches to my right and Muhammad eighteen inches to my left. Both were of Indian extraction, one being Pakistani and the other Indian. The other experience was where I worked for six months in a small company that was entirely staffed by lebanese, both christian and muslim. The two owners with whom I worked closely everyday were a lebanese christian and a muslim syrian.  With just about all of these people I participated in completely engaging but civil debate. Muhammad and I had a lot of fun as he was a huge cricket fan and taught me the ins and outs, but he was apolitical. Feisal was an observant muslim of a liberal sect. We traded a lot of details about life in a mosque in comparison to life in a synagogue. He was a bona fide genius I think, and he also opened my eyes to issues vis-?-vis the muslim world and the U.S.A. The syrian was a brilliant man extremely well versed in contemporary history. He had me really working hard and I had to re-examine a lot of previously conceived notions I had.  By the way, all without exception were western educated; not necessarily in western institutions but rather in the western tradition.  I like to think I am an intellectually honest person. I invite you to travel the link to my posts to examine my arguments.  This has been my experience:   I have met here some rabid pro-zionists whose posts I personally find embarrassing. The rabid anti-zionists seem to be an order more vitriolic. I can sense the blind hatred. Also, they are easily frustrated with the simplest critical thinking. There really is no debate here at all. It is all quips based on self-enforcing and cross-referenced hate propaganda. To even question its veracity brings immediate indirect fire as opposed to an actual response.  Based on my own reading and research there is certainly a palestinian narrative of merit. To say otherwise, in my opinion, is nonsensical. I have participated in excellent debate and exchange of information here on these boards. A fair number of times I have been challenged by posters' comments that required me to stop and re-examine my thinking. Always these have been alleged facts that I was not previously aware of and I spent the time researching the issue and verifying the facts. A Case on point is my discussion with Ed regarding water usage in Israel/P-Territories.  Without exception every post that I felt had merit and that I fact-checked did not pan out. Some citations were to reputable pro-Palestinian sources that  I had to delve a lot deeper into the primary source data (UN reports and the like). A lot was just unsubstantiated myth mongering devoid of any sources at all. Some others were simply foolish. I remember one citation that was to a headline to the effect of ""Israel - [some atrocity]"". I tried clicking the headline but there was no link, no links anywhere on the page for that matter. It was just a list of made up headlines. I very strongly notice that all of the pro-palestinian myth mongering is cross-referenced. Each ""argument"" refers to other self-documenting resources that refer back in a web of cross-references.  Then, of course, there is Pallywood and fauxtography, the arab/muslim art of invented videos and photographs.  Finally, there are out-and-out lies that are apparent on their face, ranting really.  I did my own research into the apparently endless list of Israeli atrocities. I found several clear acts of improper military behaviour, but only a few.  I found some of unacceptable civilian behaviour towards palestinians. Then there is the government based acts, an example of which is uprooting olive orchards. Finally, there are actual war crime type atrocities, for example, the 800-900 arab deaths in this category during the 1948 war as explained by the ""new"" historian Benny Morris.  Now, do I mean that palestinians are not killed--not at all. In my view, the vast majority of so-called atrocities, war crimes, genocide, ethnic cleansing, animal behaviour, etc. ad nauseam, is related to the palestinian insurrection (Intifadah) in the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank and the Israeli attempts to manage and quell the insurrection.  These actions fall into a few categories:  1. Clearing a designated military reserve of protestors 2. Quelling insurrection (rock throwing, etc.) 3. Immediate retaliation to armed attacks 4. Pro-active attacks by the IDF to degrade and destroy palestinian military capabilities 5. Ongoing border screening  In other words, I don't deny the suffering of individual palestinians. I both sympathize and empathize with the pain and suffering. The two peoples are at war. The IDF will make every effort to avert collateral damage, but civilians will get hit when a Qassam stockpile is hit. Palestinians have to wait hours at the border, but every parcel, truck, ambulance, and person must be physically checked for suicide vests and ordinance smuggling. Only about 5% of palestinian attackers get through. That means for every bombing in Tel-Aviv or Jerusalem, 19 others were thwarted or caught at the border. For better or worse, until a final settlement is reached, Israel is responsible for the populations in the territories and for order and security. Violent insurrection cannot be allowed lest anarchy take hold. As part of the occupation, certain areas are classified by military authorities. The justness of it or not is not my point. When a soldier with a rifle under orders to clear the area tells you to do so, one takes his life into his own hands to disobey. When Qassam rockets are fired into Israel, you can bet your grand-mother's pearls that a bigger rocket is coming back your way. For that matter, if a palestinian fires rockets next to a civilian home, he knows that the return fire may hit that home as well. He ought to take responsibility for his choice. What are eight year olds doing throwing stones at tanks intermixed with adults armed with assault rifles.  All of this is ongoing military operations between two peoples at war. They are not acts of genocide or ethnic cleansing or anything like that.  With some exceptions, I find most pro-palestinian posters fall into one single pattern: a two or three sentence post of unsubstantiated outrageous claims. When one calls them out for evidence, I have gotten the run-around as I described above, or just non-answers. I have been engaged in serious debate by pro-palestinian supporters on these boards in only a small minority of instances.  I find that this profound penchant for dishonest debate is not so much acts of actual dishonesty, rather it is part and parcel of the overriding arab social characteristic of face-saving, i.e. self-deception. That is, as far as I can tell, so long is face is saved publicly, all is well. Prime examples of this are astounding claims of military victory in the face of catastrophic losses and on the verge of military annihilation.  By and large I find the scales of dishonest debate tips acutely toward the pro-Palestinian side.",NEGATIVE,0.9935405850410461

For starters, in case you werent aware, a persons income tax is based upon their annual earnings in salary and holdings such as stocks, money market accounts, properties etc.  Even a MASSIVE tax break (for which there is a cap no matter who is in the White House as noted earlier) is not going to be a dent in the loses a very wealthy person would face in a weak economy.  Many wealthy people are doctors, business owners, heads of large business whose salary and bonuses are dictated by the companies profits.  There are more people in the US that fall into the categories of middle-income, lower-middle income.  These are the people that spend the most.  So tell me how a rich doctor is going to benefit from their being fewer people with quality health insurance or the ability to pay their medical fees?  Tell me how a rich business owner is going to benefit from the regular joe having less money to spend at his place of business?  Tell me how a wealthy guy who runs a factory or retail store is going to benefit from lower production, less staff and lower profitibility?

Does anyone actually know?  By the way, this just reminds me of a sad personal story:  Years ago my mother was on an Ulpan program rooming with a young Palestinian woman and they became close friends.  At that time my mother was a big swimmer and availed herself of the swimming pool on a daily basis for exercise and heat relief.  After a number of months, her friend asked if she could go with my Mom early one morning and have my Mom teach her how to swim.  They did this once and it resulted in verbal hostility from some Arab men who happened to witness it.  She wore a VERY conservative (by Western standards, of course) one piece swimsuit and was careful to remain fully covered up until the last possible moment when entering and exiting the pool.  A day later, the woman came to my Mom in tears because the word had gotten back to her family in the West Bank and they had phoned her threatening to remove her from the program if she did that again.  She went again -- this time even earlier to avoid being seen and even more careful with regard to modesty.  Her family made good on their threat and she was gone in a matter of days and my Mom was never able to contact her and to this day doesn't know whether she received any of her letters or not or what became of her.  I don't care what people wanna do with regard to modesty and dress, in theory:  But I do object to legal adults being denied the right to make their own decision on what they want to wear in places where it's acceptable for others to dress the same -- ie, if it's at a pool where swimsuits are accepted attire at that time.",NEGATIVE,0.9998065829277039

Hi Conny, Zabak, others  Lets not pretend that Rahman's paper settles the issue.  I think the current understanding is that sexual orientation does not fall neatly into discrete categories, but rather places a person on a continuum ranging from enitrely attracted to the same sex or entirely attracted to the opposite sex. Whatever genetic influence there is on sexual orientation then, it is not 'either or'.  Beyond that cultural factors do seem to push peoples orientation this way or that. Its worth noting that absolute sexual categories did not/do not exist in some cultures. (Ancient Greece)  It is a little smililar to whether people are left/right handed oddly enough. It is estimated that hereditary factors account for just 32 percent of variability in handedness, but that doesnt account for 90% of people being right handed. A cultural bias towards right handedness accounts for that more effectively.  People can and do change their sexual orientation in the course of their lives. 'Gay' people go 'straight', 'straight' people go 'gay'.  the importance of cultural factors in determining sexual orientation should be acknowleged. Self actualisation is an important factor in personal happiness (and therefore, social cohesion). People must not be brought up to think that they are (or must be) exactly one way or another.  Here is a decent paper on it:  <a href=""http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15176896"">cat.inist.fr/?aModel...</a>  Note that my concern is that people should be able to freely discover their position on a continuum rather than to ""cure"" a natural/social orientation.

You attempt to dismiss any and all disagreement with your representation by pre-empting a few potential counterpoints and denoting them ""go[ing] round in escalating circles"", thereby showing no willingness whatsoever to hear differing viewpoints as you prematurely belittle them with your ""again if you wish"".  But that's PRECISELY what you're doing...  going round in circles!  Or at least that's how it appears to me in the absense of any apparent desire to go anywhere else...  Israel have said that they were within their rights under the ceasefire to engage in this action (and, according to the first link [IHT] that comes up from your google link, made this clear before the action):  Okay, this is something you think was a mistake and perhaps you and certainly others might disagree and believe it's more than just a bad PR decision but an actual violation...  But the main point you're missing is that the ceasefire violation by Hezbollah that Israel is claiming it was responding to has NOT been used by Israel as an excuse to abandon the ceasefire further than this action (or, presumably and reportedly, any others like it), from your beeb link:  ~ ~ ""Israel...insisted the truce held."" ~ ~  So where are you going?  Let's even say we agree that it was a PR mistake...  What happens next?  IS it an excuse for Hezbollah to announce a complete disconnection from the ceasefire?  IS it an excuse for the Lebanese government to renege?  Surely that gets it all back to where you suggest you don't want it -- going round in circles -- right?  Or is there something you haven't yet offered that would explain this apparent contradiction?  The BBC article you link to inadvertently touches on this further in parallel to this point and I think it's key to the conflict and, unfortunately, in much of the discussion going on it's being avoided:  ~ ~ ""The BBC's Nick Childs in Beirut correspondent says the UN's main concern is that the incident both highlights the urgent need for UN reinforcements and will put off potential troop contributors, because it projects an image of insecurity."" ~ ~  An ""image of insecurity""?  It didn't have that before?  So ""the UN's main concern"" is that any troops it might send will be aware of what's going on?  Is that a sneaked snippet of the planned 'rules of engagement'... know as little as possible about the conflict and make sure any and all troops are given a false sense of security just to ensure that they will, once again, be nothing more than sitting ducks in the line of fire?  And these parallels emanate from the same underlying point illustrated above and again as we see from the Lebanese Defense Minister (also from the beeb article):  ~ ~ ""He said any rocket fired from Lebanese territory would be considered collaboration with Israel to provide a pretext for it to strike. ... ...[he] said that if the UN failed to give ""clear answers"" in response to the raid he ""might be forced to ask the cabinet early next week to halt the army deployment in the south""."" ~ ~  So there we are:  That's the only result I can see of a discussion criticizing Israel for this 'PR disaster'...  Excuse for Hezbollah, excuse for Siniora and excuse for the UN.  Of course it warrants addressing but it's your purpose that will define how it's addressed and your address which will expose your purpose and, at the moment, it appears to be a desire to go round in circles and add your weight to the 'PR disaster'.",NEGATIVE,0.9985985159873962

For example many countries in Asia were occupied by the Japanese Imperial Army from China to Korea to the Philippines to Thailand etc and the civilians under occupation never started blowing each other up in markets or temples etc.  When the US army occupied Japan and other asian countries the Japanese &amp; other civilians never started to kill each other.  Nazi Germany occupied most of Europe and the Europeans never started to kill each other.  Then the Russians occupied Eastern Europe and the allies Western Europe after the war and the civilians didn?t start to kill each other after three days, three years etc.  India was occupied by the British for years and years and the Indians didn?t suddenly turn on their neighbors and start killing them.  Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Macedonia etc were occupied by the Ottomans and the civilians didn?t turn on each other.  The Muslims occupied Spain for seven centuries and the Spanish didn?t start killing each other after a 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 months or 3 years etc.  Tibet has been occulted by the Chinese since the 1950s and the Tibetan civilians didn?t start to kill each other.

There are so many possibilities and different scenarios, that I think we can only point at the most general and usual cases. So I think that that is why the Harrison Ford case is  not applicable to most people. Certainly this is millionaire celebrity and given his financial status, as you said, he will not be confronted with the typical cases of not being able to pay babysitting for the not so pleasant tasks J, more time available for parenting, etc.   ?Perhaps in some ways even a better parent as they would have years more wisdom and life experience to pass along, be more mature themselves than say a very young parent might be.?  Yes that may be a positive thing, but also the bigger the generational gap the most difficult it may be to understand each other.   ?So, I think that a given persons financial stability, emmotional readiness, maturity level and frame of time to actually spend with the child - particularly during the early developemental years, plays more of a significant role in what sort of parent they will make than does their age.  ?Lets face it, its just like that Harry Chapin song ""Cats in the Cradle""? I love that song?.  ? by the time most kids are in their late teens and beyond, they dont spend all that much time with their parents anyway.:? True. This is however more than not the rule of life, but by the time children pass the teenage stage, get into adulthood and most of all, as they become parents themselves, then they will start ?respecting? their parents again and begin to understand in retrospect why their parents acted the way they did?so parents now become the best friends, allies and advisers.  This is the part that I see as downside when having children late in life?  Now in the case of this woman in the article, she had twins. Speed, I can tell you how I was super-handful with one!
